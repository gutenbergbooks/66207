</div>

<p class='c005'>I take great pleasure in here presenting Volume VII of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span>
of the American-Irish Historical Society. It is hoped the book
will be found equal, in point of general interest, to those preceding
it and helpful to the organization to whose labors and progress
it is devoted. The Society continues in a prosperous condition,
has no indebtedness, and is steadily adding new members to its roll.
The historical papers contained in this work will be recognized as
of more than usual value, while the historical notes and other material
will, we are confident, be likewise fully appreciated.</p>

    <div>NOTICE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING AND DINNER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: The annual meeting and dinner of the American-Irish
Historical Society will take place at the Hotel Brunswick, Boylston
Street, Boston, Mass., on Thursday evening, January 24, 1907.</p>

<p class='c009'>A committee will be on duty at the hotel all day to receive members
and guests, especially those coming from other cities and states,
and render them such assistance as may be desired. A general reception
will take place in the evening from 5 to 6 o’clock, upon the
conclusion of which the annual meeting of the Society will be held.
The annual dinner will be at 7.30 p. m.</p>

<p class='c009'>This will be the tenth anniversary of the Society, and it is eminently
appropriate that its celebration should take place in Boston,
the city where the organization was founded. These annual gatherings
of the Society are always of very great interest, bring together
a distinguished company, and are long remembered by those participating.
The forthcoming event will be no exception to the rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tickets to the dinner are now ready at $3.50 each. They can be
obtained by addressing Mr. M. J. Jordan, 42 Court Street, Boston,
Mass. Make checks payable to the American-Irish Historical Society
and forward to Mr. Jordan at the address given.</p>

<p class='c009'>Members are at liberty to invite personal guests. The evening
reception committee will include the following Boston members of
the Society: Capt. D. J. Gorman, Bernard J. Joyce, Michael H.
Cox, Patrick M. Keating, J. W. Fogarty, P. A. O’Connell, Charles
V. Dasey, T. B. Fitzpatrick, P. H. Powers, John E. Gilman, Hon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Joseph H. O’Neil, W. B. Sullivan, F. L. Dunne, P. B. Magrane
and James W. Kenney.</p>

<p class='c009'>We hope that all who possibly can will be with us on this occasion,
as it is desired to make it a red-letter event in the history of the
Society.</p>

<p class='c011'>The event was a very successful one and was participated in by a
large gathering. Owing to the unavoidable absence of Admiral
McGowan, the president-general of the Society, the business session
was presided over by Mr. M. F. Dooley of Providence, R. I., treasurer-general
of the organization.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. T. H. Murray, secretary-general of the Society, was present,
but owing to illness was assisted in his duties by Mr. P. F. Magrath
of Binghamton, N. Y.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reading of the minutes of the preceding annual meeting was
omitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The annual report of the secretary-general was presented, accepted
and adopted, as was that of the treasurer-general. Both
reports showed the Society to be in an excellent condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several new members were admitted to the organization.</p>

<p class='c011'>The annual election of officers then took place, the result being
as given on pages <a href='#Page_5'>5</a> and <a href='#Page_6'>6</a> of this volume. The business session
was then dissolved, and after an interval the company proceeded to
the annual dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Thomas B. Fitzpatrick of Boston, the well-known merchant,
presided. On his right and left were seated the Hon. John Hannan,
mayor of Ogdensburg, N. Y.; the Hon. Charles E. Gorman, Providence,
R. I.; the Hon. Joseph H. O’Neil, president of the Federal
Trust Co., Boston; Mr. M. F. Dooley, of the Union Trust Co.,
Providence, R. I.; the Hon. Joseph F. O’Connell, congressman-elect,
Boston; Mr. D. H. Tierney, Waterbury, Conn., and the Hon.
Daniel O’Connor, Australia. The following letter was received
from President-General McGowan:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I regret exceedingly that I will not be able to attend the annual
meeting and dinner on January 24th. My cold does not improve,
and unless there is a change very soon, I will have to start for a
milder climate.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a great disappointment to me not to be with you on that day
and I beg you will express to all the members of the Society my
regret at my enforced absence and the hope that next year I may
be more fortunate.</p>

<p class='c009'>My attack of “grippe,” which started the middle of last month,
has left me with a most provoking cough, and I do not get my
strength back. With kind regards, believe me,</p>

<p class='c011'>In addition to those already mentioned as present at the dinner,
after the business meeting, there were the Hon. Patrick T. Barry,
Chicago, Ill.; the Hon. Thomas Z. Lee, Providence, R. I.; Mr.
John Morgan, New York City; the Rev. Father Lyons, Boston,
Mass.; Mr. R. J. Donahue, Ogdensburg, N. Y.; Mr. Edmund Reardon,

Mass.; Capt. D. J. Gorman, Boston, Mass.; Mr. A. B. Sutherland
(guest of Dr. M. F. Sullivan), Lawrence, Mass., and other
gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The after-dinner speeches were along the Society’s line of work
and were of a most interesting nature. In his opening remarks,
Mr. Fitzpatrick told of the early efforts of the Irish in Boston, and
how their labors were an inspiration to the men and women of today.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Hon. Charles E. Gorman of Providence, R. I., followed the
toastmaster with a story on the bravery and chivalry of the Irish
race. The early conditions in New England, and Rhode Island
in particular, were outlined, after which he spoke on the struggles
of the Irish to get a footing and show their spirit. He paid a
stirring tribute to the work accomplished by the Celts and the Teutons
and how their spirit of liberty managed to overcome difficulties.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Hon. P. T. Barry of Chicago was well received when he arose
to speak on the part the Irish took in the development of Chicago,
the West and the great Northwest. His historical data was particularly
interesting from the time of Chevalier McCarthy’s advent to
the present. Congressman-elect Joseph F. O’Connell of Boston
spoke on “The Part Played by the Irish in the Early History of
Our Country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. A. B. Sutherland of Lawrence, Mass., who is of Scottish
blood, delivered an interesting speech, in which he told of what
Irish civilization had done for Scotland and all northern Europe,
and particularly of the spirit of liberty given to the Scotch by Irish
example.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rev. John J. Lyons illustrated how the Irish had done magnificent
work in the interest of the church, and he made an earnest
appeal for friendship on all sides and good will to mankind in
general.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The Hon. Daniel O’Connor of Australia electrified the gathering
with his witty remarks, and his narrative of the Irish influence in
British literature and jurisprudence was unusually interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. D. H. Tierney of Waterbury, Conn., spoke for a few minutes
on the Irish in Rochambeau’s army, after which the Hon.
Joseph H. O’Neil and Michael J. Jordan, both of Boston, addressed
the gathering briefly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the meeting adjourned the Society paid a tribute to President
Roosevelt, who is an active member of the organization.
The tribute took the form of the following preamble and resolution:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Preamble and Resolution of Thanks and Appreciation From the American-Irish Historical Society.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At the annual meeting of the American-Irish Historical Society,
held in Boston, Mass., on the evening of January 24, 1907, the following
minute was unanimously adopted:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Whereas</span>, The American-Irish Historical Society has learned of
the excellent work of our distinguished fellow-member, the Hon.
Theodore Roosevelt, as embodied in his article on “The Ancient
Irish Sagas,” recently published, and believing that some appropriate
action should be taken to show our appreciation of the study and
research exhibited in the able contribution mentioned, it is</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Resolved</i>, therefore, that in the opinion of this Society a splendid
example is set by President Roosevelt in finding the time and
opportunity, in the midst of his many duties and responsibilities, to
devote attention to a subject dear to us. We heartily congratulate
him upon the results he has so ably exemplified and set forth as the
outcome of his researches into early Irish history.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. A copy of the foregoing preamble and resolution was forwarded to President
Roosevelt and the Society received a cordial reply.</p>
</div>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Extracts from Letters Received.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The following are extracts from letters of regret:</p>

<p class='c011'>From Mr. John J. Rooney, New York City: “My Dear Mr. Murray:
I am exceedingly sorry I cannot be present at the American-Irish
Historical Society dinner tomorrow night. I have a heavy
case in court and cannot get away. Kindly express my regrets to
all. Sincerely, John J. Rooney.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Hon. Felix Carbray, M. R. I. A., Quebec, Canada: “I
duly received the notice for the annual meeting and dinner. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>deeply regret that distance and heavy business cares will make it
unable for me to be present. I hope you will have a large gathering
and a successful celebration.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Hon. Patrick J. McCarthy, mayor of Providence, R. I.:
“Dear Sir: Your letter in regard to the dinner of the American-Irish
Historical Society received, and I regret to state that owing
to previous engagements in Providence it will be impossible for me
to attend. Wishing you a successful meeting, I remain, respectfully
yours, Patrick J. McCarthy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Hon. Patrick J. Ryan, mayor of Elizabeth, N. J.:
“Many thanks for your circular letter announcing that the American-Irish
Historical Society is to have a reception and dinner in
Boston on Thursday, January 24, next. I appreciate the notice I
assure you, and regret to say that I will not be able to attend owing
to a press of other matters here. I hope and trust the meeting will
be a success in every way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Hon. Franklin M. Danaher, Albany, N. Y.: “Dear Mr.
Murray: I have your notice of the annual meeting and dinner of
the American-Irish Historical Society in Boston on Thursday, January
24, 1907. I have always been able to attend the annual meetings
of the Society because they happened in New York coincident
with my presence there on official business. Whether I can be in
Boston on January 24th is somewhat problematical, but I will do
so if I can. Do you expect President-General McGowan?”</p>

<p class='c011'>From Mr. Edward J. McGuire, New York City: “My Dear Mr.
Murray: It seems ungracious not to attend the Historical Society’s
dinner at Boston on Thursday evening, you Yankees have been so
generous and loyal in coming to New York, but for me it is absolutely
impossible to be present. I am engaged in a number of most
important and engrossing professional matters, and I have in addition
but recently returned from a week’s absence in the South. I
am sure you will make my excuses. I hope that you are entirely
recovered from your illness and that everything prospers with you
and the Society. With kindest regards, Very truly yours, Edward
J. McGuire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Rt. Rev. Mgr. Dennis J. O’Connell, M. A., S. T. D.,
rector of the Catholic University of America, Washington, D. C.:
“Mr. T. H. Murray, Secretary-General, Sea View, Mass. My Dear
Sir: I desire to thank you very cordially for the notice you sent me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>regarding the annual dinner, and to say at the same time with sincere
regret that I am afraid I cannot assist, for the following day,
January the 25th, is the feast of our Faculty of Theology at which
I must be present. Wishing all a pleasant time, I remain, Very sincerely
yours, D. J. O’Connell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Hon. Edward A. Moseley, Washington, D. C.: “I
regret very much that it is impossible for me to attend the annual
meeting of the American-Irish Historical Society. I really wish
that the Society would have its next meeting in Washington; I believe
it would be a good plan from every point of view. I had
fully intended to get to the coming meeting on the 24th, but I went
to Boston over the holidays, and the result is that I have as bad a
cold as I ever had in my life, and I am afraid to leave Washington.
Do have the next annual meeting in Washington, and I will contribute
in every way to make it a success, and will devote myself
to the work. With all cordial regards, sincerely yours, E. A.
Moseley.”</p>

    <div>BY JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE, LL. D., BOSTON, MASS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. This paper appeared originally in the Boston <cite>Pilot</cite>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Irish race, both here and in the old world, has suffered so
much in the way of misrepresentation at the hands of English and
pro-English writers, its merits have been so minimized and its
defects so magnified, that it is almost a hopeless task to attempt the
refutation of even a tithe of the falsehoods.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is only when a writer offers an easily accessible authority for
his statements that the general reader can take the time and trouble,
if so disposed, to investigate the reference and verify the accuracy
or honesty of the author who professes to have quoted truly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge has written, and the <cite>Century Magazine</cite>
has published an article on “The Distribution of Ability in the
United States,” in which he exalts the English race at the expense
of some others, and depreciates the Irish race, with or without malice
prepense, in a manner which is, to say the least, remarkable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lodge deals in some general statements easily susceptible of
disproof, as when he says that “there was virtually no Irish immigration
during the colonial period, and indeed none of consequence
until the present century was well advanced.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He offers no authority for this absurd statement; so it may be
assumed that he ignorantly believes it true. Perhaps he also honestly
believes in the race called “Scotch-Irish,” whom he defines as
“descendants of the Scotch <i>and English</i> who settled in the North of
Ireland.” Let these things pass. We are concerned only with the
accuracy and honesty of Mr. Lodge’s quotations when he refers to a
specific authority for facts and figures and professes to be governed
by that authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to classify the distribution of “ability,” Mr. Lodge says
that he “took <cite>Appleton’s Encyclopedia of American Biography</cite> in
six volumes, one of the largest and most recent works upon the subject,
and classified the persons mentioned therein who were citizens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the United States according to occupation, birthplace and race
extraction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lodge says that he found the work large and laborious. We
can confirm that statement; for we also have taken the six volumes
of <cite>Appleton’s</cite> and have gone conscientiously through the 14,000 and
odd names therein recorded, to see if that otherwise valuable publication
had really given the Irish race such an astonishingly poor
record as Mr. Lodge’s tables show. We find that it has not. We
find that Mr. Lodge and his authority differ so astoundingly, on
almost every point, that his deductions are absolutely worthless because
his statements are so utterly untrue.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the matter of quantity, <cite>Appleton’s</cite> gives to the Irish race a list
nearly one hundred per cent greater than Mr. Lodge professes to
have found in its pages. On the score of quality, taking Mr. Lodge’s
own test of merit, <cite>Appleton’s</cite> gives about 300 per cent more to the
race than Mr. Lodge accords it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lodge classifies race by the paternal side alone, which is
probably fair enough for practical purposes, and says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a large number of cases, especially where the extraction is not
English, the race stock is given in the dictionary. In a still larger
number of instances the name and the place of birth furnish unmistakable
evidence as to race. That error should be avoided in this
classification is not to be expected, but I am perfectly satisfied that
the race distribution is in the main correct. Such errors as exist
tend, I think, here as elsewhere in these statistics, to balance one
another, and the net result is, I believe, so substantially accurate as
to have very real value, and to throw a great deal of light on what
we owe in the way of ability to each of the various races who settled
the United States.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He counts as original settlers all who came to this country before
the date of the adoption of the Constitution, A. D. 1789; those who
came after that date are classified as “immigrants.” Taking the
<cite>Encyclopedia</cite> as his authority, he examines the birth or race extraction
of 14,243 persons therein named as having achieved sufficient
distinction to deserve mention. As a result he finds that over 10,000
of the number should be credited to the “English” race.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not worth while to inquire into the accuracy of that estimate,
since Mr. Lodge’s treatment of another race sufficiently disproves
his claims to accuracy on any score.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>In Tables “D” and “H,” covering respectively the original settlers
and the immigrants, he gives the number of men of the Irish
race who have achieved the distinction of a place in <cite>Appleton’s</cite>.
Nowhere, apparently, is any allowance made either for the distinguished
descendants of the original Irish settlers, distinguished
or obscure themselves, nor for the distinguished children of undistinguished
immigrants since 1789.</p>

<p class='c011'>Charles Carroll of Carrollton is, we suppose, credited to the Irish
of pre-Constitution days, and Thomas Addis Emmet to the “immigrant”
class, but where does Mr. Lodge place the distinguished descendants
of both? Where does he place the distinguished sons of
obscure fathers, such men as Andrew Jackson and Robert Fulton?
Certainly not among the race to which, according to <cite>Appleton</cite>, they
belong, for they have no recognition in his “double star” table, to
be described hereafter. Do they go to swell the ranks of the 10,000
English or those of the mixed and mythical “Scotch-Irish”?</p>

<p class='c011'>What does he do with Philip Sheridan, who being neither an
“immigrant” nor descended from pre-Constitution ancestors, is in a
worse case than his namesake, Philip Nolan, being a “man without
a race?” We cannot believe that Mr. Lodge ever intended committing
such a palpable absurdity, because if carried to its logical
conclusion, it would apply equally to distinguished men of all races.
Mr. Lodge himself, for all that <cite>Appleton’s</cite> tells us to the contrary,
never had a pre-Constitution ancestor, and has, therefore, no right
to class himself among the 10,000 “English,” as he presumably does.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lodge has a delightfully simple method of determining the
relative values of great men. It is by noting how much of pictorial
glory is awarded to each in the <cite>Encyclopedia</cite>. Persons whose biographical
sketches are not illustrated with a portrait are not counted
in at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who have a vignette portrait are classified as “single stars.”
The truly great, who have full-page portraits, are called “double
stars”—of these there are 58 among the whole 14,243.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lodge confesses that encyclopediac fame is hardly just in giving
double star honors to William Gilmore Simms and shutting out
Hawthorne, Poe and Lowell, but Fame is notoriously capricious of
her favors; which is why, perhaps, such authors as John Hay, T. W.
Parsons, Theodore Roosevelt and many others are sent pictureless
to posterity, while Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth and Mrs. Ann S.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Stephens are immortalized in becoming wood-cuts. Mr. Lodge
himself shines as a “single-star,” as does also Mr. E. P. Roe.</p>

<p class='c011'>But even in his stellar classification Mr. Lodge makes a singular
mistake, again on the wrong side of the Irish account. His “totals
by race extraction” allow only one double star to “Irish.” Yet
his cyclopedic authority has full-page steel engravings of the following
six, all credited to the Irish race, without any hint of a
mythical Scotch mixture: Chester A. Arthur, son of Rev. William
Arthur of Antrim; John C. Calhoun, son of Patrick and grandson
of James of Donegal; Robert Fulton, son of a Kilkenny man;
Andrew Jackson, son of Andrew of Carrickfergus; James K. Polk,
descendant of Irish Polk or “Pollock”; Philip H. Sheridan, race
not mentioned but pretty well known.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lodge is equally reckless of fact when he attempts to count
the “single stars” of the Irish race. He finds only thirteen of these
among the early settler class and eleven among the “immigrants”—twenty-four
in all. Here are the names of sixty-five, given by
<cite>Appleton’s</cite>, and not including such men of the Irish race as Lawrence
Barrett, Lawrence and Philip Kearny, J. A. MacGahan, Commodore
Macdonough and others, whose race is not specified in the
cyclopedia:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Under the first head, “Statesmen,” Mr. Lodge “includes not only
persons who have held public office, but all who as reformers, agitators,
or in any other capacity have distinguished themselves in
public affairs.” He allows nine statesmen to the Irish in his first
list. His authority, <cite>Appleton’s Encyclopedia</cite>, is more liberal, giving
them no less than thirty, including seven signers of the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not to answer assertion with mere counter-assertion, we have
compiled the following list, from <cite>Appleton’s</cite>, including only such
names as are specifically stated to belong to the Irish race, omitting
all that are claimed as “Scotch-Irish,” and not even counting men
of known Irish origin who are not so described in the cyclopedia.</p>

<p class='c011'>In so doing we purposely leave out scores of Kellys, Butlers,
Moores, Barrys, Boyles, etc. We do not wish to claim anything
beyond the strict letter of Mr. Lodge’s authority, <cite>Appleton’s Encyclopedia</cite>.
For every name in the following lists given by <cite>Appleton’s</cite>
as Irish, but possibly of remoter Scotch or English origin,
there will be found half a dozen other names in <cite>Appleton’s</cite> of obvious
Celtic Irish origin which are not here included because not so
specified in the cyclopedia. We are taking Mr. Lodge’s authority
as such, in order to show how wildly he has departed from it. Following
is the correct list compiled from <cite>Appleton’s</cite>:</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lodge is right, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, he follows his authority honestly in giving
practically the correct number of names belonging to the departments
of Art, Science and Architecture, and these alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is worth noting that, if the Irish are conspicuous by their absence
from the last named, they are gloriously prominent in the first.
The race which has given to America, Crawford, Milmore, Kelly,
St. Gaudens, Thompson, Hennessey, O’Donovan and as many more,
has contributed at least its share to the glory of the country in that
department.</p>

<p class='c011'>The corrected figures, not according to Mr. Lodge, but according
to the authority from which Mr. Lodge professed to have taken his
own are, therefore, as follows. We give first the summary of the
Lodge tables and then that of <cite>Appleton’s</cite> cyclopedia. They speak
for themselves:</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>EMIGRATION FROM NEW ENGLAND TO IRELAND.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>From Prendergast’s <cite>Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland</cite>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Prendergast’s <cite>Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland</cite> says: “Ireland
was now like an empty hive, prepared to receive its new swarm.
One of the earliest efforts of the government towards replanting the
parts reserved to themselves was to turn towards the lately expatriated
English in America. In the early part of the year 1651, when
the country, by their own description to the Council of State, was a
scene of unparalleled waste and ruin, the Commissioners for Ireland
affectionately urged Mr. Harrison, then a minister of the Gospel in
New England, to come over to Ireland, which he would find experimentally
was a comfortable seed plot (so they said) for his labours.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“On his return to New England, it was hoped he might encourage
those whose hearts the Lord should stir up to look back again towards
their native country, to return and plant in Ireland. There
they should have freedom of worship, and the (mundane) advantages
of convenient lands, fit for husbandry, in healthful air, near
to maritime towns or secure places, with such encouragement from
the state as should demonstrate that it was their chief care to plant
Ireland with a godly seed and generation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Harrison was unable to come; but some movement appears
to have been made towards a plantation from America, as proposals
were received in January, 1655, for the planting of the town of
Sligo and lands thereabouts, with families from New England; and
lands on the Mile line, together with the two little islands called
Oyster Island and Coney Island (containing 200 acres), were leased
for one year, from 10th of April, 1655, for the use of such English
families as should come from New England in America, in order to
their transplantation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In 1656 several families, arriving from New England at Limerick,
had the excise of tobacco brought with them for the use of
themselves and families remitted; and other families in May and
July of that year, who had come over from New England to plant,
were received as tenants of state lands near Garristown, in the
county of Dublin, about fifteen miles north of the capital.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Stephen Jackson of Providence, R. I., was born in 1700, in Kilkenny,
Ireland. He came to America, it is said, in 1724, to escape
political persecution. He married, 1725, August 15, Anne Boone,
daughter of Samuel and Mary Boone, of North Kingstown, R. I.
He hired land in Providence in 1745, and at this period is called
“schoolmaster.” He bought and sold several parcels of land subsequently.
In 1762, he and his son, Samuel, bought of Stephen
Hopkins, land on the new street, called Benefit Street, where they
were then living. Stephen Jackson died, 1765, July 22, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>buried in the North burial ground. His wife, Anne, was born, 1709,
September 18. She died at Pomfret, Conn., 1782, January 30.</p>

<p class='c011'>Stephen and Anne (Boone) Jackson had children as follows:</p>

<p class='c021'>1. George, b. 1727; m. Lydia Harris, daughter of Toleration and

  <h2 class='c004'>THE AFFAIR AT FORT WILLIAM AND MARY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY THE REV. THOMAS GREGORY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Just before sunset on the afternoon of December 13, 1774, Paul
Revere jumped from his foam-covered steed in front of a house in
Durham, New Hampshire, rushed in and informed its owner, Major
John Sullivan, that two regiments of British regulars were about to
march from Boston to occupy Portsmouth and the fort in its harbor.
In an instant Sullivan made up his mind as to what it was his
duty to do, and within less than two hours he had gathered his force
and was ready for business.</p>

<p class='c011'>The party, sixteen in number, boarded an unwieldy, sloop-rigged
old craft and darted off down the river to Portsmouth. It was a
clear, cold moonlight night, and presently the crude masonry of old
Fort William and Mary loomed up in the distance, reminding them
of the fact that they were close on to their quarry. When within a
rod or so of the shore their vessel grounded in the shallow water,
and in silence they waded to land, mounted the fort, surprised the
garrison and found themselves victorious without the loss of a man
or even of a drop of blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Securing the prisoners, the patriots at once broke into the magazine,
where they found one hundred pounds of powder. The powder,
along with one hundred stand of small arms, was put aboard
of their craft and taken back to Durham, where it was buried under
the pulpit of the old meeting-house in front of Major Sullivan’s
house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Six months later the battle of Bunker Hill came off, and it was
this same powder, captured by Major Sullivan at Fort William
and Mary, that enabled the Americans to kill so many of the British
in that historic encounter. Powder was exceedingly scarce in the
patriot army, and Sullivan, anticipating that such might be the case,
filled “old John Demerett’s ox-cart” with the powder he had buried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>under Parson Adams’ pulpit and sent it over the sixty-odd miles of
rocky road to Boston, where it was destined to do such good service
in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the news of Sullivan’s capture of Fort William and Mary
that precipitated the Revolution. After such a daring deed Lexington
was a foregone conclusion. In the words of another, “Sullivan
was the first man in active rebellion against the British government,
and he drew with him the province he lived in.” In an address on
the history of this part of New Hampshire, Rev. Quint, of Dover,
referring to the attack on the fort, said: “The daring character of
the assault cannot be over-estimated. It was an organized investment
of a royal fortress where the king’s flag was flying and where
the king’s garrison met them with muskets and artillery. It was
four months before Lexington, and Lexington was resistance to
attack, while this was deliberate assault.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>DOMINICK LYNCH AND HIS FAMILY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>Compiled from Various Sources.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dominick Lynch was a member of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick,
New York, as early as 1786; a prominent merchant; was of
the firm Lynch &amp; Stoughton, New York. A biographical sketch of
Mr. Lynch was published some years ago in the <cite>American Catholic
Historical Researches</cite>. It was written by Richard H. Clarke,
LL. D., and treated the subject at great length. According to Dr.
Clarke, Mr. Lynch was born in Galway, Ireland, in 1754.</p>

<p class='c011'>He married his cousin, Jane Lynch, a native of Dublin. Shortly
after, Dominick and his wife went to reside at Bruges, in Flanders,
where he established a commercial house, a branch of his father’s
in Galway. He amassed a handsome fortune in Bruges and three
of his children were born there. While engaged in business in
Bruges he became acquainted with Don Thomas Stoughton, a merchant
having commercial relations with France and Spain. Eventually,
Lynch and Stoughton formed a co-partnership for the purpose
of conducting business in America. The articles of co-partnership
were dated March 10, 1783; the capital agreed upon was
£7,500, of which amount Lynch furnished £5,000 and Stoughton,
£2,500.</p>

<p>HON. GEORGE F. O’NEIL,<br /><br />Binghamton, N. Y.<br /><br />A LIFE MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Stoughton, in pursuance of the agreement, came to New York
City and opened the business house of Lynch &amp; Stoughton. Lynch
visited London and Galway, and in 1785 sailed for America, reaching
New York June 20 of that year. Stoughton was a bachelor,
and Mr. and Mrs. Lynch, their three children and a number of servants,
went to reside with him. Later, Stoughton was made Spanish
consul at New York. Eventually, differences broke out between the
partners, the firm was dissolved and each member sued the other.
These two suits in chancery, Stoughton <i>vs.</i> Lynch and Lynch <i>vs.</i>
Stoughton, were tried before Chancellor Kent and after pending for
over twenty years, were finally decided adverse to Lynch.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter had to pay Stoughton, besides fines and costs, $25,076.
After the dissolution of the firm, Lynch retired in affluent circumstances
largely on account of the wealth he had amassed in Bruges.
It was said of him in New York that “he dispensed a bountiful and
refined hospitality.” He was an earnest Catholic, gave liberally of
his means to forward church work and was one of the representative
men who signed the “Catholic Address” to George Washington. It
is said of Lynch that upon arriving in New York, in 1785, he
brought a large amount of specie with him and the advent of a man
with such extensive financial resources created quite a stir. He was
at one time offered, for what would today be considered a ridiculously
small sum, a farm of twenty acres near City Hall, New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>He declined to buy the property, but with the same amount of
money purchased 697 acres near Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk
River. Before the year 1800 he had increased his holdings there
to about 2,000 acres. As early as 1796, he laid this property out
in village lots, and called the place Lynchville. Later, he changed
the name to Rome, perhaps in honor of the Eternal City. Between
the years 1800 and 1820, he built a woolen mill, a cotton factory
and a saw-mill at Rome, which place he had founded. It is said
that the southeast corner of Fort Stanwix was levelled to make room
for a mansion erected by him. In 1797, Dominick purchased an
estate in West Chester County, N. Y., bordering Long Island
Sound. Here he built a magnificent stone residence after the style
of chateaus he had seen in Flanders. This was his home for the
remainder of his life. He continued to dispense “munificent hospitality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>took a leading part in the social events of the metropolis,
and manifested to the end a zealous and active zeal in the growth
of the Catholic church in New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He died in 1825 and his widow in 1849. At his death his children
were thirteen in number, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>—James, Anastasia, Anthony, Dominick,
Alexander, Margaret, Jasper, Jane, Henry, Harriet, Louisa,
Edward and William. By the marriage of these children, the family
has become allied with many of the old families of New York
and Pennsylvania, including the Tillotsons, Shippens, Leas, Laurences,
Nortons, Luquers, Pringles, Maitlands, Harveys, Ridgways,
etc. James Lynch, the oldest of Dominick’s thirteen children, resided
in Rome, N. Y., represented Oneida County in the state legislature
for several years, and was later a judge of the Court of Sessions,
and of the Marine, now City, Court, of New York. Dominick
Lynch, 2d, at the time of, and after, his father’s death became
a prominent merchant in New York City. This second Dominick
was spoken of as “the most fashionable man in New York.” He
made quite a reputation as proprietor of Lynch’s Chateau Margeaux,
Lynch’s Sauterne and Lynch’s Lucca Oil. It is said of him
that he “coined money and spent it with the freedom of a prince,”
and that he “went into the best society.” He resided on Greenwich
Street “opposite the Battery.” He died in 1844. He “was a
Roman Catholic as his father had been.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dominick Lynch, 3d, grandson of the first Dominick, was a man
of great public spirit, an elegant conversationalist and the possessor
of musical talents. He became a naval officer, served under Perry
in the Mexican war, and was also in the Civil War. He died in
1884. Dominick Lynch, 4th, was a lieutenant in the Fourth U. S.
Cavalry and died some years ago. Speaking of the Lynches and
others, Barrett’s <cite>Old Merchants of New York City</cite> says: “These
Irish families are the cream of the cream of the old families here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The ship <i>Alknomac</i> sailed from the river of Sligo, Ireland, in
October, 1811, with 79 passengers. After a passage of 73 days she
was cast away at Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. The passengers and
crew were rescued and spent nine days there. Captain Hicks, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>commanded the <i>Alknomac</i>, at length provided a sloop in which the
passengers embarked for New York. Unfavorable weather continuing,
the sloop was driven ashore at Newport, R. I., December 24,
1811, where passengers and crew were again landed. The New
York <i>Shamrock</i>, describing the incident, says: “Commodore Rodgers
was on the Newport station when 79 Irish passengers were landed
from a wrecked vessel. He humanely tendered the hand of hospitality
and liberally provided them with every necessary to enable
them to proceed to New York, the port of their original destination.
Eight of the passengers who have come by land were supplied with
money, and the others who remained waiting for a passage by
water, received money, provisions and every necessary aid from the
American commander.”</p>

    <div>BY G. FRANK RADWAY, UTICA, N. Y.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Otsego Lake, in central New York, possesses not only the charm
of romance due to the pen of Fenimore Cooper, but also an historical
interest. In the year 1779 an expedition was sent against the hostile
Indians around Lake Cayuga. A brigade under the command of
Gen. James Clinton, the brother of George Clinton and father of
DeWitt Clinton (each of whom held the office of governor of New
York at one time), went up the Mohawk and then cut across through
the forest, to the head of the Otsego, finally encamping at the foot
of the lake.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Susquehanna at its source is a very narrow stream and did not
permit the floating of the 220 boats brought along by the troops.
An ingenious plan was devised to overcome this difficulty. The
small gorge through which the river flows as it leaves the lake was
dammed, thereby collecting the waters. When a sufficient amount
had been collected, the troops embarked, the dam was knocked out,
and the boats were carried by the flood to a point near Tioga, where
the brigade joined the forces under General Sullivan. It is said that
the Indians along the banks, beholding the overflow of the river
in summer, without any apparent reason, thought that it was an interposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of the Great Spirit, and fled in terror. The site of the dam
has been suitably marked by the Otsego Chapter of the Daughters
of the American Revolution.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>IRISH BUILDERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY MARTIN I. J. GRIFFIN, PHILADELPHIA, PA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Not only were Catholics—L’Enfant, the Frenchman, and Dermott,
the Irishman—the planners of the Federal City, Washington,
but a Catholic, James Hoban, a native of Ireland, was the architect
and builder of the president’s palace, as it was first called, the president’s
house as later designated, but better known as the White
House.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hoban was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1758. When only
twenty-two years old he won a medal from the Dublin Society for
“drawings of brackets, stairs, roof, etc.” It is now in possession
of his grandson, James Hoban, of Washington. He came to this
country after the revolution and soon became known as an architect
and builder.</p>

<p class='c011'>When, in 1791, Washington visited South Carolina, writes Mr.
Griffin, Colonel Laurens and others recommended to him the abilities
as an architect and the executive worth of James Hoban, the Kilkenny
Irishman, who had, since his arrival, added to the growth
and adornment of the neighborhood by the exercise of that skill
and ingenuity which the new country so much needed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hoban went to Washington city and submitted to the commissioners
a plan for the president’s palace. His plan was accepted
immediately and without hesitation after a view of the drawings
which were submitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hoban’s plan of the president’s palace being adopted, the selection
of the site on which to erect it required the personal attention of
Washington himself. So on August 2, 1792, the commissioners and
President Washington “viewed the ground, particularly at the place
for the palace. It has given him considerable trouble and difficulty
to fix his mind,” wrote the commissioners.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hoban’s design of the president’s house contemplated a central
building with wings. The central portion was executed according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to his designs and under his supervision (we are told he received
300 guineas a year for his services)—both before and after the damage
by the British in 1814. The north portico was not completed
until 1820, and then according to Hoban’s plan. Its popular name
of the White House is due to his thought of painting the brownstone
fronting the exterior walls to conceal the discoloration by smoke
and fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cornelius McDermott Roe, Patrick McDermott Roe and John
Delahunty had the contract for all the brick and stone work on the
president’s house for one season, and John Kearney did all the plastering
on the capitol.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus far in our investigations we have found that a Catholic was
one of the commissioners; that two Catholics planned the city; that
a Catholic designed and built the president’s house and also superintended
the erection of the capitol, which three Catholics contracted
to build, and another did the plastering, while Patrick Whalen dug
the cellar. Surely Irish Catholics seem to have had a goodly share
in the foundation of the Capital City.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hoban died on December 9, 1831, and was buried in St.
Patrick’s Cemetery. In May, 1863, his grandson and namesake,
James Hoban, Esq., purchased a lot in Mount Olivet Cemetery,
near Washington, and the remains of James Hoban and others of
the family were removed thereto.</p>

<p class='c011'>Patrick Barber resided in Princeton for years and here were born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>four of his sons—Francis, John, William and Joseph. Col. Francis
Barber graduated from Princeton College after securing for himself
a distinguished reputation for his classical attainments. As we may
infer from the character of Elizabethtown’s first settlers, much
attention was paid to the subject of education by the people. And
to this we may attribute the strong influence which for a long time
it maintained in the province. We find in 1767, a Mr. Pemberton
and a Mr. Reeves at the head of a school. In 1769, they left the
institution and Francis Barber was appointed to fill the vacancy. He
continued in the position until the commencement of the war, a
period when teachers and many scholars left the quiet pursuits of
science and rushed to arms for the defence of the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1776, Mr. Barber received from Congress a commission as
major of the Third Battalion of New Jersey troops, and at the close
of the year he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Third Jersey
Regiment. Subsequently, he became assistant inspector-general
under Baron Steuben, who expressed a high opinion of his ability
and services. Colonel Barber was in constant service during the
whole war. With his regiment he served under General Schuyler
at the north. He was at the battles of Ticonderoga, Trenton,
Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth, and came
near losing his life in the latter.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was at one time adjutant-general under Sullivan. He served
with distinction in the Wyoming Valley and Indian troubles. He
was actively engaged in the battle of Springfield. In 1781, he was
at the capture of the British army at Yorktown. Colonel Barber,
although not more than thirty years at his death, had twice married,
one of his helpmates, being the daughter of Moses Ogden, whose
residence was the old town home that still stands on the north side of
Elizabeth Avenue below Reed Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>So close was his friendship with Lafayette that they exchanged
swords. The sword Lafayette gave Barber is now in the Washington
headquarters at Newburgh, N. Y., while the one Barber gave in
exchange is preserved in Paris. Speaking of men noted in the military
world, a few years ago, General Stryker, president of the Society
of the Cincinnati, at the meeting of that organization, which was
attended by William P. Barber, said that he considered Colonel
Barber an ideal soldier. W. P. Barber is a great great-grandson of
Colonel Barber. Colonel Barber was the tutor of Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>After having escaped the dangers of the many military campaigns,
Colonel Barber was finally killed, 1783, by a most peculiar accident.
Just after peace had been declared, General Washington summoned
all his officers to meet him at his headquarters in Newburgh.
Colonel Barber was on his way there, and but a few miles distant,
when he came upon a gang of men chopping down trees in a piece
of woods. One of the men called to him in a warning tone to stop
his horse, just as a tree had started to topple over in his path. The
chopper thought the tree was going to fall another way, but it struck
and killed the unsuspecting officer, who realized his danger too late
to save himself. Had he been allowed to go on without stopping,
a life of such inestimable value to his country would without doubt
have been saved. He was a fine scholar, a skillful and brave officer
and rendered great and important services to his country.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CONCERNING THE IRISH MONTGOMERYS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the <cite>New York Herald</cite>, September 10, 1905, is a statement by
“L. W., London, England,” giving many details of interest concerning
the ancestry and family of Gen. Richard Montgomery. The
statement appears in the genealogical department of the <cite>Herald</cite>, of
that date, which department is conducted by Mrs. Clara H. Manning.
The statement is in answer to a correspondent and is as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“H. W. N.’s family tradition is at fault. Gen. Richard Montgomery
had no sister Elizabeth. His only sister was Sarah, wife
of Charles Jones, fourth Viscount Planelagh, and mother of thirteen
children. General Montgomery had brothers, John and Alexander.
John died unmarried in Lisbon, 1786. His administration is in the
Prerogative Court of Ireland. Alexander, the brother, was captain
in the Forty-third Regiment and member of the Irish Parliament for
County Donegal; died unmarried September 29, 1800. His will is
in the Prerogative Court of Ireland. Lady Planelagh and her three
brothers were the children of Thomas Montgomery, of Swords, near
Dublin, eldest son of Alexander Montgomery, of Ballyleek, who
married Mary Francklyn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thomas Montgomery had several brothers and sisters. His
brother, Robert, of Brandram, County Monaghan, married Sarah
Maxwell. This is the nearest Maxwell connection. Thomas had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>many cousins. Ulster has many Montgomerys of other lines. It
is said the Earl of Mount Alexander could ride at the head of a
regiment all Montgomerys. At one time in the Irish Parliament
were six Montgomerys all over six feet in height and the handsomest
men in Dublin.... By far [one of] the most noted
family of modern times is that of the Montgomerys of Grey Abbey,
County Down, a famous military stock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For all this they have a pedigree made in the eighteenth century
to take them on to the famous old Grey Abbey stock of the early
Ulster settlement. As a fact, they are descended from a thrifty
yeoman who purchased Grey Abbey after the old stock had died out.
No American Montgomerys can prove any near connection with
either the Montgomerys of Ballyleek or the Earls of Mount Alexander.
The nearest probable American connection is not of the
Montgomery name, being that of the descendants of Thomas Patterson,
who emigrated from County Donegal to Philadelphia at the time
of the Irish rebellion. Thomas Patterson was grandson of Alleriah
Montgomery, said by tradition to be a cousin of the general. Her
marriage certificate in the diocese of Raphoe indicates her as coming
from the vicinity of the general’s family, being about his age and
not belonging to any other of the Montgomery families in that part
of Ireland.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A GLANCE AT SOME PIONEER IRISH IN THE SOUTH.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY MICHAEL J. O’BRIEN, NEW YORK CITY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>No section of the Union presents a wider or more diversified field
for historical inquiry than the Carolinas and Virginia.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the territory from the Delaware River south to Cape Fear
was named “Virginia” by the English, and it is generally supposed
that it was in the present state of Virginia the earliest colonists
landed. It was, however, the Indians of North Carolina who were
the first to set eyes on the white men who came to America with the
famous navigator, Sir Walter Raleigh, in the year 1584.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among these first-comers to the Carolinas Irishmen are found,
and in the resistance to the authority and encroachments of the
British organized in that section many years later, the sons of Erin
and their descendants are recorded as having played an honorable
and prominent part.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Hakluyt’s <cite>Voyages, Navigations, Traffiques and Discouveries
of the English Nation</cite> are found some interesting facts relating to the
first voyages of the English, under Raleigh and his lieutenants, to
the western world. Richard Hakluyt was one of those who accompanied
Raleigh on his first voyage of discovery in 1584. His
<cite>Voyages and Discouveries</cite>, now a work of extreme rarity (it was published
in London over 300 years ago), is by all odds the most celebrated
book ever written on the subject, and forms the basis of all
true history of the colonization of the Carolinas and Virginia. It
is printed in the old English text of the sixteenth century, which renders
its examination a task as laborious as it is interesting. The
writer has examined the copy of this famous work in the Astor
Library, and we are sure our readers will be interested in learning
something of its contents at this stage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second voyage was undertaken by Sir Richard Greenville in
the year 1585. The company comprised 107 persons. Hakluyt’s
great work (page 254, volume 3) contains “an account of the particulars
of the employments of the Englishmen left in Virginia by
Sir Richard Greenville under the charge of Master Ralph Lane,
general of the same, from August 17, 1585, to June 18, 1586.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be observed that Greenville refers to “the Englishmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>left in Virginia.” This would lead the ordinary reader to the conclusion
that the expedition was comprised of Englishmen only, but
such an assumption would be erroneous. In those days Ireland had
a merchant marine of her own, and the ships which sailed from Irish
ports, and indeed not a few of those whose home ports were in England,
were manned by Irish seamen. (See Marmion’s <i>Maritime
Ports of Ireland</i>.) What more natural, therefore, than to expect
that Irish names should be found among the lists of these “Englishmen?”
All of the early histories of the southern colonies refer to
the first settlers as English. No suggestion is ever made, as far as
the writer can find, that these first-comers may not all have been
English, or that any Irish people were amongst them. Yet it is a
fact that Irishmen came too in search of adventure, and no better
testimony in support of that assertion can be adduced than the lists
of the names of the persons who came on these colonizing expeditions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here are some of the names from Greenvilles’ list, as they were
written down at the time: Edward Kelley, R. Courtney, Hugh
Rogers, Thomas Fox, Darby “Glande,” Edward Nugent, John “Costigo”
(Costigan), James Lafie, Francis Norris, Richard Moore, Richard
Ireland, Matthew Lyne, Dennis Barnes, “Denice” Carroll, Robert
Young, Thomas Hesket, Richard Humphrey and R. Griffin. Many
of these, undoubtedly, were natives of Ireland. This is said to have
been the first English colony that settled in America, the previous
expedition having returned with its entire company.</p>

<p class='c011'>They entered Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic by what is now
known as New Inlet, and then landed at Roanoke Island, thence
crossed over to the mainland to the eastern portion of North Carolina,
just south of Norfolk, Va. They followed the course of the Chowan
River for a short distance, and soon came in contact with the Indians.
Hakluyt’s work contains an interesting narrative of the voyage and of
the explorations of the party in Virginia, written by Ralph Lane, in
which long accounts are given of their encounters with the savage
Indians. In his account of one fight, on the first of June, 1586, he
refers to the bravery of “one of my Irish boys,” who shot Pemisapan,
the king of the Indians, “athwart the buttocks with my petronell.”
The Irish boy’s shot did not, however, bring down the Indian king,
and the wily redskin, with a number of his warriors, managed to
escape into the dense forest.</p>

<p class='c011'>But then, another Irishman, who was not afraid to face the Indian
band singlehanded, was there to finish the work of the youthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>adventurer from Erin, “for,” writes Lane, “in the end an Irishman
serving me, one Nugent, and the deputy provost undertook him”—that
is to say, volunteered to capture or kill the Indian king—“and
I, in some doubt lest we had lost both the king and my man, by our
own negligence to have been intercepted by the savages, we met him
returning out of the woods with Pemisapan’s head in his hands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The place where the bold Irishman, Edward Nugent, and the
nameless youth thus earned such prominent mention in early
American history has been located as in Chowan County, near the
present town of Edenton, N. C.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seems that in all of the early voyages of the English to the
American continent the adventurous Irishman was present. On
Raleigh’s first voyage the largest ship was commanded by a Captain
Butler, and Captain Edward Hayes commanded a vessel in the expedition
of Sir H. Gilbert to Newfoundland in 1583. Sixteen
years earlier, 1567, Robert Barrett and John Garrett commanded
ships in the expedition to Mexico under Sir John Hawkins. There
is nothing to show that these captains were of the Irish nation, but
their names have been for centuries so common in Ireland that we
venture to include them in this category.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1568, when Hawkins arrived in the Gulf of Mexico, he put
ashore a company comprising 68 men under Miles Philips, a little
north of Panuco. From the curiously-worded narrative of Miles
Philips, entitled “The voyages from Panuco, thence to Mexico, and
afterwards to sundry other places, having remained in the counterey
15 or 16 yeeres together, and noted many things most worthy of observation,”
which is contained in Hakluyt’s third volume, we glean
some interesting information.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole company was captured by a band of Indians and Spaniards,
and immediately haled before the governor, who “visited them
with the terrors of the Inquisition.” John Gray, John and Thomas
Browne, John Mooney, James Collier and John Rider were sentenced
to receive 200 lashes on horseback and to serve eight years
in the galleys; others of the company received various terms of
servitude, while others were condemned to serve as servants or slaves
in the monasteries. Three were condemned to be burned to ashes,
and the inhuman sentence was carried out in the market place of the
City of Mexico on the day preceding Good Friday in the year 1575.</p>

<p class='c011'>The three unfortunates were George Riuely (Reilly), Peter Momfrie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and “Cornelius.” Philips was unacquainted with the full name
of the latter, but in order to distinguish him from another of the
party who bore the same Christian name, he refers to him as “Cornelius
the Irishman.” In relating the circumstances of his subsequent
escape, Philips stated that several of the adventurers, after the
expiration of their terms of servitude, remained in Mexico, married
native women, and some prospered in the new country.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same volume of Hakluyt (page 286) contains the story of
“The Fourth Voyage, made to Virginia in 1587, wherein was transported
the Second Colony,” written by the commander, Captain
John White. The narrative runs in part:</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the first day of July (1587) we weighed anchor at Musketo’s
Bay, upon the fourth side of St. John’s Island, where were left behind
two Irishmen of our company, Darbie Glaven and Dennis Carrell,
thence bearing along the coast of St. John’s till evening.” The
vessels anchored in the bay for the purpose of securing a supply of
salt, which Simon Fernando, who was with Raleigh on the first expedition,
had informed White could be procured on the island. The
two hardy Irishmen, Glaven and Carrell, were selected to go ashore
and procure the necessary supply. They proceeded inland, but,
during their absence, Fernando, for some reason that does not appear,
persuaded the commander to weigh anchor, and before the two unfortunates
had returned to the shore, the vessels were far on their way.
It would be interesting if we could follow the fortunes of the two
Irish castaways among the Indians of the Danish West Indies, but
history contains no further account of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the following September, when one of the vessels of the expedition
was on its return to England, she encountered a great storm.
The crew and passengers were in sore straits on account of the lack
of food and water, expecting to perish by famine at sea. On October
16, however, when they had almost given up in despair, they sighted
land, which proved to be the coast of Kerry. By the aid of “a
hulke of Dublin” they entered Smerwick Bay, where the inhabitants
at once succored them. White relates that the whole company was
brought ashore at “Dingen a Cos,” where the sick sailors and passengers
were taken care of by the local doctor.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>HON. JOHN S. WHALEN.<br /><br />New York Secretary of State.<br /><br />A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The writer of the narrative pays a well-merited tribute to the
inhabitants of Smerwick and Dingle for their timely and spontaneous
aid. They stayed at Smerwick for over two weeks; there
White distributed some potato plants among the people, “the first
ever seen in Europe.” It is generally supposed that it was Raleigh
who first brought the potato plant to Europe, but according to
White’s account, it was he who introduced it, and that it was the
inhabitants of the County of Kerry who were the first Europeans
to taste the esculent tuber.</p>

<p class='c011'>Could John White, who wrote the official account of, and commanded
this expedition, have been an Irishman? His story of the
fifth voyage is dated “from my house at Newtown, in Kilmore, the
fourth of February, 1593.” There is no such place as Kilmore in
England, but there are several such places in Ireland, and the name
is distinctively Irish. The town of Dingle, County Kerry, has always
been and even is still known to the inhabitants as “Dingen a
Cos.” It will be observed that White referred to the town by its
Irish, not by its Anglicized appellation, which, to some, may be suggestive
that a knowledge of the Gaelic language, which, happily, most
Irishmen spoke in those days, was one of the accomplishments of
the historian mariner.</p>

<p class='c011'>And is it not highly probable that White and his officers, who came
to form such friendly intercourse with the fisher-folk of the Kerry
coast, may have informed them of “the great land beyond the sea,”
with the result that, on his subsequent voyages to Virginia, he was accompanied
by not a few of the hardy natives of the Kingdom of
Kerry?</p>

<p class='c011'>After the forfeiture of the immense estates of the Desmonds in
Munster in 1584, Raleigh came into possession of 12,000 acres in
Cork, Waterford and Tipperary. He built and made his home in
the castle of Lismore, and soon after established at the neighboring
ports of Waterford and Youghal a large trade in lumber and barrel
staves with France and Spain. His ships were largely manned by
Irish sailors, and it is entirely within the bounds of probability that
Raleigh impressed into his transatlantic crews some of the sailors
and fishermen of the Munster coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the charter which Raleigh received from the English crown on
March 27, 1585, empowering him to hold the lands which he had
colonized in America and apportion them among the colonists, reference
is made to “persons from England and Ireland,” thus showing
that Irishmen were among the first white settlers of the western
world.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Among those who landed in North Carolina from White’s fourth
expedition, and “remayned to inhabite there,” were Thomas Coleman,
Edward and Winifred Powell, James Hyndes, William and Henry
Browne, Thomas Ellis, Michael Millet, James Lafie, Maurice Allen,
Richard Berry, Dennis and Margery Harvie, William Waters, Martin
Sutton, Hugh Patterson, Thomas Humphrey and John and Brian
“Wyles.” Most of these names are common to Britain as well as
to Ireland, but, without doubt, some of them were natives of
Ireland.</p>

<p class='c011'>These colonists all either perished from famine or were slain by
the savage enemy. Some are supposed to have sought asylum among
the Hatteras Indians at Croatoan, who were friendly to the whites.
Lawson, one of the historians of North Carolina, writing in 1714 of
the natives of Croatoan, relates how the Indians told him that some
of their ancestors were white people and “could talk in a book as we
do,” and that many of the Hatteras Indians had gray eyes, which are
known only among whites.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his account of the fifth voyage, White tells of their arrival at
the mouth of the Roanoke on August 17, 1590. A great storm raged;
the ship’s boats were tossed about at the mercy of the waves, and
eleven of the company drowned, among them Edward Kelly, Edward
Kilborne and Robert Coleman. These three are mentioned as
“among 7 of the chiefest men of the expedition.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hawk, one of the historians of North Carolina, says that “in
1666 the Lords Proprietors had agents employed in seeking emigrants
on the continent of Europe, and in Ireland, Scotland and the
West Indies,” and the same author in referring to the divers religious
beliefs professed by the people of North Carolina (about 1700),
refers to “the Irish Romanists.” It is to be regretted that we have
no means of tracing the names or careers of any of those “Irish Romanists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hewatt’s <cite>Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Colonies
of South Carolina and Georgia</cite> (published at London in the year
1776), is referred to by historians as an authoritative work. In
this book many references are made to the early Irish settlers of the
Carolinas. The author describes the dreadful extremities to which
the poor settlers in the vicinity of Charlestown (now Charleston), S.
C., were reduced in the year 1667.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the government of Sir John Yeamans a civil disturbance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>broke out among the colonists, which threatened the ruin of the settlement.
“The Proprietors,” says Hewatt, “were unable to furnish the
colony with regular supplies, and the spots of sandy and barren land
poorly rewarded their toil. Many of them were unskilled, and the
European grain which they were accustomed to sow soon proved suitable
to neither soil nor climate. The settlers began to murmur
against the Proprietors and to curse the day they left their native land
to starve in a wilderness. While they gathered oysters for subsistence
with one hand, they were obliged to carry the musket in the other
for defence against the Indians.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In this emergency, a true son of Ireland is seen to have been in the
forefront of the battles waged by the afflicted colonists. Florence
O’Sullivan was one of the leading men among the settlers of Charlestown,
some of whom were his countrymen, and to whom they looked
for guidance and counsel. O’Sullivan is said to have come to South
Carolina with Governor Sayle. He was surveyor-general of the
province until he was succeeded by John Culpeper in 1671. He is
thought to have been of the famous family of that name whose
paternal home was on the borders of Cork and Kerry, and which
gave to America schoolmasters, governors, a celebrated general of the
Revolutionary army, and in later days men who distinguished themselves
in every sphere of activity in the new country.</p>

<p class='c011'>To add to the troubles between the colonists and the Indians, it
is related that about this time there was great fear among the Carolinians
of an invasion by the Spaniards from the South. Militia
companies were formed in and around Charlestown to resist invasion,
and O’Sullivan had been placed in command of a body of men on an
island in the harbor—now known as Sullivan’s Island. Their situation
was one of great danger and they were instructed to warn the
inhabitants on the first approach of the enemy, and then return to
shore. “The great gun”—evidently the only one available—was in
the immediate charge of O’Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spaniards did not put in an appearance; the scanty supplies of
the party soon gave out, but they stuck to their post until starvation
stared them in the face. They remained until all hope had fled that
their supplies would be replenished, and when they were not forthcoming,
O’Sullivan and his men, deciding that to perish from hunger
would be an inglorious end, deserted the island without consulting
the governor and joined the discontented party in the town.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Thereupon, we are told, the people became ungovernable and
threatened to compel the authorities to relinquish the settlement.
O’Sullivan was arrested by the town marshal and “compelled to find
security for his good behavior.” Vessels were despatched to Virginia
and to Barbadoes for provisions, but, before they returned, a
ship arrived from Europe with supplies and a number of new settlers.
“The newcomers revived the drooping spirits of the people and encouraged
them to engage in more vigorous efforts. The governor,
sensible of the hardships the people had suffered, readily forgave
them,” and O’Sullivan and his friends were released from further
restraint.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spanish authorities at St. Augustine, “on learning the belated
news of the discontented and miserable condition of the Carolina
colonists,” advanced with an armed party as far as St. Helena Island,
about 50 miles south of Charlestown, to dislodge or destroy the
settlers. Brian Fitzpatrick, a well-known “character” of the settlement,
is said to have deserted his friends at this juncture and to
have gone over to the Spaniards. What his purpose was in doing
so does not appear. However, reinforcements arrived to aid the
Carolinians, upon which the Spaniards evacuated St. Helena and retreated
to Augustine.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the death of Governor Yeamans in 1674, the inhabitants
called a meeting at Charlestown, when they elected representatives
for the purpose of making laws for the government of the colony.
Thomas Gray, Henry Hughes, Maurice Mathews and Christopher
Portman were the four deputies chosen by the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1680 Richard Kirle, who is described as “an Irish gentleman,”
succeeded to the governorship, but he died six months after taking
the reins of office.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elsewhere we have referred to the wholesale exportation of the
Irish by Cromwell, mainly to the Island of Barbadoes, during the
first half of the seventeenth century. In time, those who survived
the tropical climate became freemen, and eventually even some became
landowners, planters and the business men of the island.
Numbers of them, on gaining their freedom, sailed for the American
coast with their families. They had been apprised of the opportunities
open for them in the South, as the planters of Virginia and
the Carolinas had their agents in the West Indies inducing them to
settle on the mainland. In John Camden Hotten’s famous work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>there is a list of those who departed from Barbadoes in the year 1678,
which is described in this quaint language:</p>

<p class='c011'>“List of what Ticqtts. have been granted out of the Secretary’s
office of the Island of Barbadoes for departure off this island of the
several psones hereafter menconed, beginning in January, 1678, and
ending in December following.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These are seen to have sailed for Virginia and the Carolinas and
other American colonies:</p>

<p class='c011'>On one ship, the <i>True Friendship</i>, commanded by Capt. Charles
Kallahan, these sailed from Barbadoes:</p>

<ul class='index'>
  <li class='c007'>Jeoffrey Burke</li>
  <li class='c007'>Thomas Clovan</li>
  <li class='c007'>Richard Lynch</li>
  <li class='c007'>Patrick Maddin</li>
  <li class='c007'>Thomas Swiney</li>
  <li class='c007'>Samuel Wall</li>
</ul>

<p class='c011'>Those who left Barbadoes for America in the year 1678 are the
only ones recorded by Hotten, but for many years there was a constant
stream of wanderers leaving the West Indies for the American
coast. We are as yet unable to procure any records but those of the
year 1678.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus we see what a great infusion of Irish blood Virginia and
the Carolinas received in the year 1678 alone. Some of these were
servants, but among them also were men of family, who either settled
down on the plantations or received grants of uncultivated lands
themselves, which, in course of time, they converted into fruitful
estates. It has been well said that “the fighting races don’t die out,”
and surely the blood of these early Gaels must have been a potent
factor in moulding the Americans of later generations in the South.</p>

<p class='c011'>Irish families are invariably large, and as the same homely virtue
is usually practised by their descendants, it will not be deemed an
exaggeration when we say that thousands of the present natives of
the South are descended directly or indirectly from the Irish colonizers
from Barbadoes of the last half of the seventeenth century.
There is no system of calculation by which we could arrive at any
adequate idea of the probable number of American descendants of
those early settlers, but, if we adopt the simple method of taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the number of generations that have elapsed since their coming, and
then apportion, say an average of five persons to each family for each
succeeding generation, we can safely conclude that when American
historians refer to the pioneers of the South as wholly “of Anglo-Saxon
origin,” they are playing fast and loose with their imaginations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The provincial authorities were anxious to attract immigrants to
open up the virgin forest and extend the bounds of their domain,
so we find them in communication with the government agents in
England and Ireland, offering the most flattering inducements to
all who desired to settle in the new country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farmers, artisans and agricultural laborers were particularly
needed, while they objected to the importation of convicts and other
undesirable persons. Irish political refugees were sometimes classed
as “convicts,” and while the provincial history, supported by other
testimony of an indubitable character, indicates that great numbers
of Irish “convicts” settled in Virginia, it is seen that once they had
landed on the soil, they were, in a manner, “tolerated” and permitted
to stay, and accordingly were parcelled out among the planters and
others who needed the services of able-bodied men.</p>

<p class='c011'>The privations suffered by those imported Irish “convicts” under
the vassalage of their colonial masters are, in some cases, beyond
description, and would shake the credulity of the most sympathetic.
Many of them occupied even lower positions than the Southern
slaves of a later day. Not only were they the tillers of the soil,
the woodsmen of the forest, and the builders of the highways, but
they occupied “the firing line” in the resistance of the planters to
the attacks of the savage redskins. Here where the ravages of the
Indians were so terrible, these Irishmen and boys, so rudely torn
from their own country, inflicted on savagery many a mortal blow
and opened the way for the civilization whose fruits we now enjoy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The continued cry for settlers attracted the avarice of many of
the Cromwellian adventurers in Ireland, who thus became most efficient
aids in carrying on the barbarous work of the English commissioners,
who were appointed by government to exterminate the
Irish.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Prendergast relates in his <cite>Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland</cite>,
they had agents actively engaged throughout Ireland, “who were
authorized by Parliament to seize women, orphans and the destitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>to be transported to Barbadoes and the plantations of Virginia.”
Among the destitute were those whose ancient properties had been
confiscated by the crown and many of whom had become wanderers
over the stricken island, or had become inmates of the workhouses.
“The commissioners for Ireland,” says Prendergast, “issued orders
to the governors of garrisons to deliver all prisoners of war; to the
jail-keepers for all offenders in their custody; to the masters of
workhouses for the destitute in their care, and gave directions to all
in authority to seize those who had no visible means of livelihood
and deliver them to the British agents.” All unfortunates who were
thus caught were quickly conducted to the waterside and there herded
like so many cattle until such time as a sufficient number had been
gathered in to embark them on board some ship bound for the West
Indies or the coast of Virginia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of the English adventurers in Ireland also engaged in the
business of man-hunting on their own account, and we find from the
records of Virginia that on April 12, 1621, Sir William Newce, an
English officer who resided in the County of Cork, wrote to the governor
“offering to transport two thousand persons to Virginia.” The
same records indicate that Daniel Gookin, an Irish Quaker merchant
of Cork City, was in the business of transporting cattle from Ireland
to Virginia. On one occasion, he came in person to the colony,
and, seeing the probable advantages of a permanent settlement in
the country, he sailed from Cork in the <i>Flying Harte</i> with a large
number of his countrymen, who, we are told, “were exceedingly well
furnished with all sorts of provisions and cattle,” and landed at
Newport News in November, 1621.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding that the records of Virginia say that this large
colony came from Ireland, they are referred to by historians, who at
all make reference to them, as “English.” The fact that they were
so “well furnished” would also indicate that Ireland sent forth other
colonizers to America in those early days besides the “convicts” and
the “destitute.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the “Records of the London Company” (the Proprietors of
Virginia), Daniel Gookin is mentioned as having undertaken “to
transport great multitudes of people and cattle to Virginia,” and as
having “received patents for 300 people.” The records do not state
from where this large colony came, but, from the fact that their
leader had formerly been a merchant in the city of Cork, from where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>his first contingent sailed, it is entirely within the bounds of probability
that the second colony was largely, if not entirely, composed
of Munstermen.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1622 many of the colonists were massacred by Indians, after
which the remainder were ordered to abandon the outlying plantations
and to concentrate their forces about the stronger ones. Gookin’s
Irish settlement, which had been located near the mouth of the
James River, back of Newport News, was one of those ordered to
be abandoned, but he refused to obey the order, and, “gathering together
his dependants, who by that time numbered only 35, he
remained at his post, to his great credit and the content of his adventurers.”
(Stith’s <cite>History of Virginia</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1637 Gookin received a grant of 2,500 acres of land in Upper
Norfolk, now Nansemond County, and in 1642 he was appointed
commander of the county. The court records show, under date of
May 24, 1642, that “Daniel Gookin, late of Ireland,” was still a
resident of Upper Norfolk County. His son, Daniel, left Virginia
for Massachusetts, where he became superintendent of Indian Affairs,
with the title of major-general. He was also the author of a
history of the Indians. It is said that his descendants are now very
numerous in the United States.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neill, in his <cite>History of the English Colonization of America</cite>, a
most authoritative work, gives in full a sermon preached at Bowe
Street Church in London in 1622, by a famous clergyman named
Rev. Patrick Copland, who had been employed by the East India
Company in Barbadoes. In this sermon he referred to “a fleete of
nine sayle of ships that not one person out of 800 who had been
transported out of England and Ireland for the plantations of Virginia,
had met with any mishap by the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a footnote to the remarks of the preacher, the historian in referring
to the great exodus from Ireland to the American colonies,
remarks that “Ireland has always been a hive from which America
has derived sturdy hewers of wood to subdue the forests.” In 1622,
Rev. Patrick Copland was appointed first president of the College
of Virginia and general manager of all its properties. The college
was founded by King James in 1622 and was established at Henrico
City, fifteen miles below Richmond. (See <cite>Old Churches and Families
of Virginia</cite>, by Bishop William Meade.)</p>

<p class='c011'>At this period there must have been a goodly number of Irish in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Virginia, if we are to judge from the contents of a little book, “suitable
for a projected school in Virginia,” prepared in 1621 by an
English Puritan minister named John Brinsley. The book was
intended as “a plea for learning and the school master.” The
author stated that “the incivility among manie of the Irish, the Virginians,
and all other barbarous nations” grew “from their exceeding
ignorance of our Holy God and of all true and good learning.”
On another page the author said it was his unfeigned desire to adapt
the book “for all functions and places, and more particularly to
every ruder place, and more especially to that poor Irish nation with
our loving countrymen in Virginia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How very solicitous he was for the “uncivil” Irish! To him, of
course, they appeared rude and uncivil because they did not in those
days speak in the English tongue, but in their own undefiled and
mellifluous Gaelic. The book was presented by Brinsley “at a court
held for Virginia on December 19, 1621,” on which occasion a committee
was appointed to determine whether the book was suitable
for distribution among the school children. This circumstance is
related by the historian Neill.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few years ago there was issued from the government printing
office at Washington, D. C., a volume entitled: <i>A Calendar of John
Paul Jones Manuscripts in the Library of Congress</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The volume is of great interest, is arranged chronologically and
contains 883 entries. Most of these mention letters written to and
from Jones during the Revolution and cover a great deal of ground
relating to that trying period. These records are very valuable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Frequent mention is made in them of Walsh’s Irish Regiment of
Marine Artillery, French Army, and the Calendar, as published,
also mentions other people of Irish birth or blood who took a prominent
part in the struggle for American liberty. We extract from
the book:</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>NEHEMIAH WALTER, BORN IN IRELAND, 1663.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At a meeting of the Cambridge (Mass.) Historical Society held
in Cambridge in 1906, a paper was read by William Coolidge Lane,
Esq., in which he devoted some attention to the career of Nehemiah
Walter. The matter is of so interesting a nature that we here reproduce
a portion of the paper, the title of which is “The Nehemiah
Walter Elegy on Elijah Corlet.” Walter was born in Ireland in
1663 and came to New England in 1679. Mr. Lane tells us that
he became a minister highly esteemed here.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the age of thirteen he is said to have readily conversed in
Latin. He had been apprenticed to an upholsterer in 1674, but it
was found that his tastes were altogether literary. After coming
to this country, he was at first placed under Ezekiel Cheever, the Boston
schoolmaster, but entered college almost immediately, in 1680.
He was butler in 1683, and graduated in 1684. Soon after, he
made a voyage to Nova Scotia, where he became proficient in French,
but returned to study in Cambridge, and was often employed by
Corlet as his assistant. “It reflected a luster on his character that
the memorable Mr. Elijah Corlet, master of the Grammar School
in Cambridge, used to express a distinguishing value for him by
employing him to officiate at times in the care of his school when
obliged to be absent himself, always esteeming his place well supplied
by Mr. Walter, and fully confiding in his skill, prudence and
diligence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Elegy was composed when he was but three years out of
college, and was still studying for the ministry in Cambridge. In
1688 he was ordained as a colleague with John Eliot in Roxbury,
Mass., then 84 years old. His people in Roxbury, and Eliot himself,
showed a deep affection for him, and the liveliest satisfaction at
having secured him for their minister. Walter continued as the
minister of the church in Roxbury up to 1750, so that his ministry
and Eliot’s together covered a period of one hundred and eighteen
years. He was for many years a member of the corporation of Harvard
College, and sided with Increase Mather, his father-in-law.
After Mather’s exclusion from the presidency, he attended no more
meetings of the corporation, and was considered to have abdicated
his office.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>IRISH INFLUENCE IN THE LIFE OF BALTIMORE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY D. J. SCULLY OF BALTIMORE, MD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is a peculiar thing to study out fairly, even without setting
down aught except that which can be actually proved, what an important
part Irishmen have taken in shaping this Irish-named city
which in the estimation of those who do not stop to think, is deemed
an “Anglo-Saxon” community. This phrase, Anglo-Saxon, is now
the thing, especially among some educators. It is a handy phrase.
It may mean something, but as often means nothing in particular.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is like the stuff coined at trial tables, such as “brain-storms”
and “Dementia Americana,” sufficient for the atmosphere of a courtroom,
but no where else on earth, where common sense is supposed
to prevail. Hence the delicious and unmeaning phrase, “Anglo-Saxon”
this and “Anglo-Saxon” that, as used by the educated few,
to mislead the so-called uneducated many. It is naturally a bold
man who would call an Irishman an Anglo-Saxon to his face, but
the average American educationalist and writer does not make such
statements to the Gael in propria persona.</p>

<p class='c011'>He does it at long range, and hides behind his school book and
his inkwell until the storm has passed by. The Irish who have
influenced and who have directed in many ways the past of Baltimore
laid no claim to be Anglo-Saxons and no one in their day
sought to claim them as such. They were rather proud of their
Irish birth and descent and made no effort to hide it. But it was a
fact that it was no shame in those days to be Irish, and nobody
thought so, not even the English.</p>

<p class='c011'>If it had been so awful to be Irish, no doubt the early settlers
and founders of the city would have never allowed it to be named
Baltimore. Prior to the Revolution the most important merchants
and educators, and even professional men in the town, were Irish
by birth. They laid the foundation of the town’s trade and commerce
and built it up not only morally and physically, but financially.
The man who laid the foundation of the town’s trade was Dr. John
Stevenson, who, although a physician, had an eye to trade, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>coming direct from Ireland deemed it wise to establish a line of ships
between this city and Irish ports.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the beginning of Baltimore’s commerce, which for nearly
seventy-five years after Stevenson’s pioneer line was established, almost
rivalled New York’s commerce in general, and in many ways
excelled it. This will be refreshing news to many, but is not by any
means overdrawn. The work done by Stevenson in establishing
trade for Baltimore was continued by the Purviances, William Patterson,
Bowly, John O’Donnell, John Smith, William Smith, William
McDonald, Robert and John Oliver, Wm. Wilson, Talbott
Jones, Isaac McKim, Robert Garrett, Luke Tiernan, Cumberland
Dugan, David Stewart, Stephen Stewart, James Calhoun, John
Sterrett, John McLure, Thomas Russell, Samuel Hughes, William
Neill, Hugh Young, Patrick Colvin, Alexander Pendergast, Patrick
Bennett, Robert Welsh, Mark Pringle, William Kennedy, James O.
Law, Hugh McElderry, Charles M. Dougherty, William Walters,
John McCoy, D. J. Foley, Hamilton Easter, Robert Neale, Hugh
Birchhead, John Coulter, and others, who, from time to time, have
figured prominently in the shipping and commercial annals of Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of these men were not only the pioneers, but the leaders
for years in the matters which concerned the carrying trade of
Baltimore and also in the business concerns of the town and city.
Their names are so closely associated with the history of Baltimore
for the first hundred years of her history at least that it is impossible
to disconnect them. They were honest merchants of the old school
and their methods were direct and above suspicion. They laid the
foundation of Baltimore’s reputation for business honesty. Their
trade was with the East and West Indies, with South America and
with Europe. Their white-winged clippers sailed every known sea,
and their house flags were known in every country, aye, even by
the savage African.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is highly interesting to trace the rise and rule of these expatriated
Irish merchants who came to Baltimore, many of them with
money and business experience, driven from Ireland by England’s
unjust tariff laws, the same in character as those which now apply to
our “possessions,” Porto Rico and the Philippines, to “encourage”
their trade and commerce. These men hated England as strongly
as they loved fair play. They waxed rich and placed everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>they had at the services of their fellow citizens and of their country.
They were well aware of England’s hypocritical methods and
thus when the Revolution came on they cast their fortunes to a man
with the colonies, and gave of their blood, their experience and
their means to assist the patriots.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the Revolution, in Baltimore and Maryland they were
prominent in all works of importance. Thus we see Samuel Purviance,
the chief man of the town; Purviance was a leading merchant.
He was chairman of the Committee on Correspondence, a sort of
Ways and Means Committee, and as such he raised supplies for the
patriotic cause and supervised methods of defense. His services to
the patriot cause were vast, and he was frequently complimented by
Washington and the Continental Congress for his services. He was
largely instrumental in helping Lafayette to clothe his half-starved
and half-clothed army when on its way to the South to prosecute
that historic campaign which ended in the surrender of Cornwallis
at Yorktown.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus he played a prominent part in one of the historic events in
history, and considering the present status of this republic, the most
momentous campaign in history. The Irish merchants who contributed
to this fund to buy cloth and make uniforms for Lafayette’s
ragged army were Messrs. Purviance, William Patterson, John McLure,
Daniel Bowly, Ridgely and Pringle, James Calhoun, James
McHenry, Charles Carroll, Wm. Smith, Alex. Donaldson, Samuel
Hughes, Russell &amp; Hughes, William Neill, John Smith, William
Smith, Hugh Young and Robert Patter Purviance. William Smith
and William Patterson and other Irish merchants were also prominent
in the committee work during the Revolution, and if it had
failed, would have no doubt decorated the short end of a hangman’s
rope for their love of liberty. The services of Charles Carroll of
Carrollton and of his cousin, Charles Carroll, of Mount Clare, to the
patriot cause and to the city and state, even the nation, it is needless
to recount here, as they are well known.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were Irish-Americans, however, and not ashamed of it, and
their influence in the city and its environs were considerable along
all lines. William Patterson gave Patterson Park to the city, and
also contributed largely to the foundation of many public enterprises,
some of which survive today as monuments to the activities
of himself and his fellow Irishmen. Prime among those monuments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>is the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Isaac McKim, another
Irishman, founded the first free school set up in Baltimore. It still
stands at Baltimore and Aisquith streets a monument to him, and
has been in its day a strong sphere of influence. John Oliver, another
Gael, founded the Oliver Hibernian Free School, which has
been for nearly a century a wide center of influence for good. It
was the first school established in the United States for the exclusive
education of Irish-Americans, and was established at a time
when Americans of other races were without free schools of any
kind. Prominent in the establishment of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad and of the Northern Central Railroad were other Irish
merchants and professional men, such as Robert Garrett, Alexander
and George Brown, the latter of whom conceived the idea of
building the road; Isaac McKim, Charles Carroll of Carrollton,
John V. L. McMahon, the Irish American lawyer, who drew that
first railroad charter ever drawn for the Baltimore and Ohio, which
has served as a model ever since; Patrick McCauley, the Irish educator;
Talbott Jones, Robert Oliver and others. These men gave
not only their influence to these roads, but their money. How
well they built, facts establish. John O’Donnell, the Irishman, was
the man who named Canton, on the southeast side of the basin, because
he thought it looked like Canton, China; and he was the first
president of the Baltimore Gas Light Company. What that company
has developed into the present shows. His son, Gen. Columbus
O’Donnell, was for many years the honored president of the
company.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gen. Wm. McDonald was the first man to run packets on the
Chesapeake Bay, and also the first to run steam vessels. And thus
he was the founder of Baltimore’s great bay trade. That he was
a man of influence the conditions of the present prove. He may
have builded better than he knew, but he built greatly. Alexander
Brown, Robert Garrett and Isaac McKim were practically the
founders of the banking business of this city, and with others of
the great Irish business men influenced the financial interests of
Baltimore for many years. In fact, their descendants have a powerful
influence in banking matters locally at this time. Every one
is familiar with the tremendous influence exercised in railroad circles
for many years by the Irish-American, John W. Garrett, and his
son, Robert Garrett. There can be no question about those facts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>In the religious concerns of the city the Irish have ever played
an important part. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic
church in this country, the first bishop and archbishop of which
was John Carroll, an Irish-American. Since his day the Irish have
been in the forefront in Catholic affairs in Baltimore, and the pewholders
and attendants at the Cathedral and other Catholic churches
have included many of Baltimore’s leading citizens. St. Mary’s
Seminary has educated hundreds of Catholic priests who have gone
out and labored for the salvation of souls. Of these Levites the
great and almost overwhelming majority have been Irish-Americans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of these good men have spent their lives in this city and
have proven great sources of influence for upliftment to their fellowmen.
The Irish names of the priests and bishops who have labored
here in Baltimore would make a respectable directory for information
on the municipality’s work for the betterment of men. Many
will recall the names of the saintly McColgan, Dolan, McManus,
Coskery, Slattery, McCoy, Dougherty, Malloy, Dugan, Gaitley, McDevitt,
and many others of equal note who have served prominently
in this city and have been towers of strength to their co-religionists.
The stature of Archbishop Carroll in his day was heroic, and he
was regarded as one of the chief citizens of the republic, as his
famous successor, Cardinal Gibbons, is today.</p>

<p class='c011'>The similarity between Dr. Carroll and the cardinal on the lines
of personal influence is remarkable. What Dr. Carroll was in his
day a century ago, the cardinal is today, and the person who is
familiar with the cardinal’s character knows what power and inspiration
that is for good. Other prelates who were of Irish extraction
and who labored here were Archbishops Neale and the illustrious
Kenrick, the latter one of the greatest of church writers and
a strong man of his day. In other denominations we have Dr. Patrick
Allison, the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, and
a remarkable man in many ways, who was the friend of Dr. Carroll,
and his contemporary. Rev. John Glendy, a native of Ireland, who
was a rebel in 1798, and had to fly for his life to this country, was
the first pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church, and an orator
of unusual ability. In their day they were strong men, and exercised
an overmastering influence for good upon their flocks. Rev.
John Healey was the first Baptist minister in Baltimore town, and
founded the first Baptist chapel. He ministered here for many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>years and was without doubt an influential man. The congregations
of the Presbyterian and Baptist churches included a number of
prominent Irish business and professional men, in fact the cream of
the business men of the town and city belonged to them. Hence
they were widespread centers of influence and they have so remained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their descendants to this day include many of Baltimore’s leading
citizens in all lines of activity. The first Methodist preacher that
we know of who preached in the vicinity of this city was Robert
Strawbridge, the Irishman. He preached about the countryside, it
being as much a felony for a Methodist preacher to preach as it was
for a Catholic priest to say mass in his day in Maryland. We know
that there were several well-known Irishmen who were among the
first members of the first M. E. church, old Light Street, now Mount
Vernon Place Church; among them being Patrick Colvin and Patrick
Bennett. This Colvin afterwards was buried from the old
Light Street church, which caught fire during his funeral, and was
burned to the ground. His daughter founded the old Colvin Institute
in his honor, and Colvin Street is named after him. He was
an influential merchant as well as a leading Methodist.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first mayor of the city, James Calhoun, was an Irish-American.
The first secretary of the navy from Maryland was an Irishman,
James McHenry, after whom the fort is named. It is well
to remark that Fort Carroll is also named after Charles Carroll, the
Irish-American. The first secretary of state and attorney-general
from Maryland was Robert Smith, son of John Smith, the Irishman.
Gen. Samuel Smith, the Revolutionary hero, who served more years
than any other from this state in the United States Senate, also commanded
the forces at the battle of North Point and the defense of
Fort McHenry. The first and only chief justice of the United
States from Maryland was Roger Brooke Taney, the Irish-American,
who was also an attorney-general of the United States. One
of the two secretaries of the navy from this state was John Pendleton
Kennedy, the Irish-American. All of these facts serve to show that
the Irish have played some part in public affairs in this city and
state.</p>

<p class='c011'>Past and present, the Irish element has been so closely identified
with the history of Baltimore that it has played an important part
in influencing every detail of the life of the city. Deny it as some
will, the influence is still apparent in the city’s spheres, probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>not so prominently as in the long ago, but still markedly. Prosperity
has somewhat dulled the ambition of the local Gael, but that he
is still in evidence, commercially, religiously, professionally, socially
and industrially, the shallowest of investigations will prove. The
readiness of the Irishman to assimilate with other nationalities in
our country may have had something to do with the disappearance
from the prominent places which they formerly occupied of the leading
families of the city who bear the names of the splendid men
who at one time led in the city’s advance. But considerable of the
wealth and the influence of the city is still held by the descendants
of these old pioneers, and by those who have succeeded them in the
life of the City of the Calverts.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LOOKING BACK AT OLD CAMBRIDGE, MASS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Extract from an address by Prof. Charles Eliot Norton at a meeting
of the Cambridge (Mass.) Historical Society, October 30, 1905:
“But even a greater change than that from country village to suburban
town has taken place here in Old Cambridge in the last seventy
years. The people have changed. In my boyhood the population
was practically all of New England origin, and in large proportion
Cambridge-born, and inheritors of Old Cambridge traditions. The
fruitful invasion of barbarians had not begun. The foreign-born
people could be counted up on the fingers. There was Rule, the
excellent Scotch gardener, who was not without points of resemblance
to Andrew Fairservice; there was Sweetman, the one Irish
day-laborer, faithful and intelligent, trained as a boy in one of the
‘hedge-schools’ of his native Ireland, and ready to lean on his spade
and put the troublesome schoolboy to a test on the Odes of Horace,
or even on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arma virumque cano</span></i>; and at the heart of the village
was the hair-cutter, Marcus Reamie, from some unknown foreign
land, with his shop full, in a boy’s eyes, of treasures, some of his
own collecting, some of them brought from distant romantic parts
of the world by his sailor son. There were doubtless other foreigners,
but I do not recall them, except a few teachers of languages in
the college, of whom three filled in these and later years an important
place in the life of the town,—Dr. Beck, Dr. Follen and Mr.
Sales.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was considerable popular opposition manifested [in New

from about St. Patrick’s to the Fifth Avenue, or Middle Road, as
it was then called, site. In the [N. Y.] <cite>Truth Teller</cite> appears the

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: The subject of procuring a suitable place for a general
Catholic burial ground in this city has, for a long time, excited a
deep interest among us. I beg leave, therefore, to suggest a few
remarks on the best method to be adopted for the accomplishment
of so desirable an object, before any definite measures are taken for
a permanent location.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It appears by a hand-bill circulated a few days ago, that the
trustees of St. Patrick’s Church, without consulting the Catholics
of this city, have bought a tract of land opposite the Botanic Garden,
a distance of between four and five miles from the city hall;
that the nature of the soil is entirely unfit for the said purpose;
and that this place has been actually appropriated by them for a
general Catholic burial ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Query? Have the trustees of that church or any of the other
Catholic churches in this city the right to act definitely upon this
general subject without previously ascertaining the opinion and
obtaining the consent of the heads of families belonging to this
Catholic community?</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“This question ought to be fairly discussed before any final decision
is made on the location of the contemplated cemetery; and I
hope the columns of your widely circulated paper will be always
open for the discussion of this point of general interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This affair, in the humble opinion of the writer, ought to be
managed by a separate board, composed of the Right Rev. Bishop
of the diocese and two members from each congregation, duly elected
by the pewholders of the several Catholic churches of this city, with
power to select the ground, the location, to make regulations, etc.,
etc. This suggestion is made with the view of ascertaining the
sense of the Catholics of this city (who have very liberally contributed
to the support of their several churches and charitable institutions)
respecting this interesting question which agitates their
minds.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>“And a Catholic resident of the city of New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the meeting of the trustees on March 6, 1833, every member
present pledged himself to use his utmost endeavor “in finding and
prosecuting the invaders of the vault out of town,” which seems to
indicate that the opposition to the up-town movement had taken a
very radical turn. Previous to this, however, the idea of locating
the graveyard there was abandoned, and on August 29, 1832, a committee
of five trustees appointed to provide “a good and convenient
location for a new graveyard,” paid $37,050 to Alderman Charles
Henry Hall for the block bounded by East Eleventh and Twelfth
streets, First Avenue and Avenue A.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is related that Mr. Hall soon after repented of his bargain
and offered to pay $50,000 if the block were deeded back to him.
The offer was refused, but 100 feet in depth on three sides of the
plot was sold to lighten the debt and the rest of the land, 413x206
feet, was devoted to cemetery purposes. Permission for the first
interment was given on March 13, 1833, and from that date until
the old Eleventh Street burial ground was officially closed in
August, 1848, the total number of interments made in its limits was
41,016. As has been stated, the interments in St. Patrick’s graveyard,
from May 25, 1813, to March, 1833, were 32,153, so that in
these two old downtown graveyards in thirty-five years, a total of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>73,169 Catholics were buried. These figures are taken from Archbishop
Corrigan’s paper on “The Catholic Cemeteries of New
York” and are therefore official. The Avenue A end of the Eleventh
Street plot was originally a hollow and had to be filled in
about eighteen feet above the level at the time of its purchase.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a wooden fence around the property at first and this
was replaced by the iron railing that now encloses it. The high
brick wall around St. Patrick’s was put up just before the anti-Catholic
excitement of 1836 and served as a protection to the old
church that largely helped, when manned by stout defenders, to
awe the mob that assembled to plunder and destroy it. In the same
year, June 5, 1836, it was determined to rebuild St. Peter’s Church
in Barclay Street. The graves in the little space about the church
were opened and most of the remains reinterred in St. Patrick’s
graveyard. Some of the pioneers were left undisturbed and still
repose under the walls of the new church built over the old site.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dead who sleep about the walls of old St. Patrick’s made up
the very flower of the pioneer families, mainly Irish, who built up
the church in New York. Among the long list are the first pastors
and their assistants, Fathers Michael O’Gorman, Richard Bulger,
Charles Brennan and Peter Malou—who was a general in the Belgium
army and then a Jesuit. One of his sons became a bishop in
his native land—Fathers Luke Berry, of St. Mary’s; Gregory B.
Pardow, an uncle of the Jesuit of our day; James Neale, Carberry
J. Byrne, Thomas C. Levins, John N. Smith of St. James’ and Dr.
John Power, V. G. The remains of the bishops of the See, except
the first, were transferred from old St. Patrick’s to the crypt of the
Fifth Avenue Cathedral after it was opened.</p>

<p class='c011'>The parents of Cardinal McCloskey were buried in old St. Patrick’s
and so were a son of the famous French general, Moreau,
Capt. Pierre Laudais, of the navy, who fought with Paul Jones in
the Revolution; Thomas, the father of the great lawyer, Charles
O’Conor; Thomas S. Brady, father of James T. and Judge John
R. Brady; Capt. James McKeon, of the army in 1812 and father
of John McKeon; Andrew Morris, Stephen Jumel, Dominick Lynch
and his numerous children; John B. Lasala, the Denmans, the Hargous,
Binsse, Coughlan, Brandegee, De Londe, Shea, O’Brien and
other prominent old New York families.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Eleventh Street graveyard the 41,016 dead are of a later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>period, but include many names of special local interest on the
old stones, such as the Murphy, Lynch, Carroll, Hanly, Sweeney,
Bradley, Davey, McMahon, Holahan, and other families. A local
character, who died September 26, 1838, and was buried here, was
an Italian named Joseph Bonfanti, who kept what might be called
the first “department store” in New York. It was located at 297
Broadway, and it was his boast that no one could go into his store
and ask for anything in fancy articles he could not produce for sale.
He advertised in rhymes and some of the efforts in this direction
are wonderful productions. Local fame had it that he kept poets
on salary to supply his needs in this direction. His tombstone told
that he was born in Monticello, December 9, 1798, was “universally
esteemed as an affectionate husband, a kind father and a sincere
friend,” and that,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Cheerful he journeyed through life’s chequered wild,</div>
      <div class='line'>Honest, sincere, benevolent, mild.</div>
      <div class='line'>As husband, father, friend, fulfilled his part,</div>
      <div class='line'>Affection’s smile the sunshine of his heart.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Capt. John McMahon had a monument erected to him by the
Montgomery Guards, of whom he was commander. He was a
native of Limerick, Ireland, and died aged 37 years on April 17,
1849.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another epitaph was as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This tomb was erected by Rosanna, widow of John Connolly,
Jr., carpenter, of Gargin, parish of Killaly, County of
Galway, Ireland, in memory of the most affectionate of husbands,
who died in New York on the 6th day of March, 1841,
aged —— years; as also her daughter Mary, who died on
the 10th of August, 18—, aged —— months, as also her
son, Michael, who died on the 1st of August, 1840, aged
—— months.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This stone has been sent her by her father-in-law as a token
of respect for her and love for his son John, her husband.
May their souls rest in peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dated Galway, Ireland, 1846. This stone has been sent
her by her father-in-law, Michael Connolly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The stone to the memory of James, son of Denis and Winifred
Hanley, who died November 28, 1839, gave this advice:</p>

      <div class='line'>Prepare for death and follow me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On October 29, 1845, the Alsop farm of about 115 acres in Newtown,
Long Island, was purchased for a new place of burial, and
at a special meeting of the trustees of St. Patrick’s on July 31, 1848,
it was ordered that “the cemetery at Newtown Creek, recently consecrated
in part should be called Calvary, and placed at the disposal
of the public; that after August 2 the Eleventh Street burial
ground as well as the free vault at Fiftieth Street, should be permanently
closed.” Calvary Cemetery began to be used August 4,
1848, when the first interment, that of Esther Ennis, was made.
Subsequent purchases of land made the territory consecrated to the
burial of the dead more than 300 acres. From August, 1848, to
January, 1898, there were 644,761 interments there.</p>

<p class='c011'>From January, 1898, to the present, there have been about 200,000
interments, thus making in round numbers 850,000 interments
in all so far at Calvary Cemetery.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE KELTS OF COLONIAL BOSTON.</h2>

    <div>BY THOMAS ACKLAND, BOSTON, MASS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I am going to unfold for you a chapter of unwritten history; to
tell you in a brief way the story of the part played by men of Erin
in the early life of this city—from the time of its settlement in
the year 1630 down to the opening of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>Historical works do not touch the narrative, Cullen’s <cite>Story of
the Irish in Boston</cite> excepted. Yet even that, admirable as it is and
much as it contains, falls far short of giving a complete account.
I know not the reasons for this inexcusable neglect of historians,
but I have my opinions on the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story should have been written for two reasons at least; (1)
because the Irish were here in large numbers at the period of which
I am treating; and (2) they rendered important services to the
community.</p>

<p>JAMES E. SULLIVAN, M. D.,<br /><br />Providence, R. I.<br /><br />A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>This paper will develop some interesting and striking facts concerning
the early history of Boston, and to Americans of Irish blood,
unless they be students of colonial history, it would prove a revelation
were they to read it. You will see from this narrative that
the Irish of those by-gone days were not all hewers of wood and
drawers of water, despite the tremendous handicaps of racial and
religious hostility and the disproportion of the numbers in comparison
to the English.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the contrary, some of them shone as patriots and statesmen;
in the fields of art and invention; and in various ways of lesser importance
there were many whose names deserve recording in a discourse
of this nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some years ago I became interested in a letter which appeared in
one of our daily papers containing a few facts about the pioneer
store-keeper of Boston—the first person to start a business here
and thus earn for himself the title of “The Father of Boston Merchants.”
The reason for my interest lay in the fact that he was
an Irishman. His name was John Cogan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Histories of Boston and the chapters on colonial Boston in the
histories of the United States, as might be expected, both ignore the
story of John Cogan, and you would search the city in vain were
you looking for a memorial of any sort to him. Neither is there
tablet nor memorial of any sort marking the site of that humble little
shop, which was the first link of the great chain of mercantile establishments
which have followed in its wake. Historical spots of even
less interest are, and properly, suitably marked, but for some reason
the site of Boston’s first place of business has been ignored by our
municipal authorities and historical societies.</p>

<p class='c011'>I determined to try to rescue John Cogan’s name from the practical
oblivion which enshrouded it and discover details of his career
sufficient for a newspaper or magazine article. My researches into
the musty records of the past were well rewarded and my discoveries
I hope to give the public through some reputable magazine or
journal in the near future.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was while engaged in this long and laborious work that I discovered
a new vein, as it were, in Boston’s history, and following it
up I found much of the material which goes to make up this paper
and which suggested its preparation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had it been our good fortune to have had a directory containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the names of the residents of Boston each year since its settlement
we would have found in every one of those works, with perhaps the
exception of the first two, Keltic names, and in the entire period of
which I treat some thousands of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Undoubtedly these statements surprise you. Naturally. Yet I
could easily make them good. And furthermore I believe it to be
quite likely that if we made a careful research among the names
of the Kelts in colonial Boston that we could easily duplicate ten
per cent or more of those borne by readers of this article.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the thousands of these names I have compiled I select a few
for illustration—Blake, Barrett, Boyce, Bryan, Bishop, Boyle and
Burk; Collins, Carey, Connell, Conner, Casey and Cunningham;
Drury and Downing; Flannagan; Griffin; Healy, Hart, Harkins
and Hurley; Kennedy; Lynch and Lane; Murphy, Moore, Martin,
Mackey and McLean; Norton and Neale; Power and Powell;
Strain; Timmins; Welch.</p>

<p class='c011'>The children of Erin began coming here from practically the
foundation of Boston. As Cullen says: “English of all things, it
(Boston) was of necessity anti-Irish, and classed this unfortunate
people with the heathen tribes of the forest; yet, among her earliest
records appears the distinctively Irish names of Cogan, Barry, Connors,
MacCarty, Kelly; throughout her colonial history, when the
wild Irish, the Pope, the Devil and the Pretender were classed
together and hated in the lump, the Irish were in their midst,
though Irish Catholicity remained till near the Revolution almost
unrepresented.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet this fact is disputed. One well known newspaper writer of
Boston, an Irishman, too, declares: “It is quite safe to say that there
were no Irish at that time (1630) among the settlers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now that assertion may or may not be true. But I would say in
reply to it that if the Irish were not here as early as 1630 there
was at least one representative of the race in the colony in 1632<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
and another in 1634<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a>, both prominent, too, by the way, and Irish
have been here ever since.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. John Cogan, already alluded to.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. William Hibbens.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The gentleman referred to also says: “Up to that time (1647)
there was practically no infusion of Irish blood in New England.”
In reply to that I would answer that if the other large centers of
New England had as many Kelts as did Boston up to and including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>1647—and I would not be surprised if they had—this gentleman’s
statement would stand disproved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under Cromwell’s government many Irish people were sent to
New England. On their arrival they were sold as servants or
slaves by those at whose charge they were brought here. This
slavery, however, was only temporary, and generally for a period
of four years. It was distinctly understood that this service of the
Irish was to be in direct payment for the trouble and expense of
transporting them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The men of Irish blood were not prominent in the early story
of the colony, with a few exceptions. But that was neither their
fault nor to their discredit. The reasons for this were in brief the
racial antipathy on the part of the colonists; their hatred of the
religion professed by the mass of the Kelts; the social ostracism of
the English toward the children of Erin; the legislation in Ireland
which forced the natives into, and kept them in, ignorance from an
educational standpoint; their poverty, another heritage of England’s
misrule of their country and the smallness of their numbers
in comparison with the English settlers.</p>

<p class='c011'>But time works wonders and brings its revenges! The erstwhile
tiny English and Puritan colony has become a great city, one of the
greatest in America, in fact, and the stronghold of the Catholic and
Kelt. Only the other day it was governed by a man of that faith
and blood, and he was the successor of four other mayors born in
Ireland or descended from Irish people, while the majority of the
leading city officials were of the same class.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the professions and business life also men of Irish blood are
making a good showing here. And as to religion, our clergy of
Keltic blood outnumber those of all other nationalities and so do
they all the non-Catholic ministers combined.</p>

<p class='c011'>I know you will be now interested to hear of John Cogan, to
whom I referred in the beginning of this paper. For a quarter of a
century he was prominently identified with the colony—from 1632
until his death in 1658. He probably came from Cork. The late
John B. Reagan, of Dorchester, noted for his historical research
regarding the Irish in America, said of the first of Boston’s Keltic
citizens: “Among those who came over in the so-called Winthrop
fleet, composed of ‘people from all parts,’ were several merchants
from the maritime ports of Ireland, of whom John Cogan was one.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>In my researches for details of Cogan’s career I found this reference
to him, from Lechford’s Notebook: “Whether John Cogan, of
Boston, Mass., was related to this family (the Cogans of Chard,
Eng.,) or not I do not know. He appears to have been from
Devonshire, as in 1639 he gave Isaac Northcut, of Honiton, a power
of attorney to receive any legacy under the will of his mother,
Eleanor Cogan, of Tiverton, in Devon.” Still, this would not
prove that Cogan was English, as thousands of Irish have settled
in England from an early period.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cogan was virtually one of the founders of Boston, one of its
leading citizens, one of its wealthiest and most enterprising, and a
pillar and one of the founders of the First Church. And I am glad
to say that the colonists were sensible enough to so far overcome
their prejudices as to appreciate what sort of man he was, for they
honored him with numerous public offices and positions of trust.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a member of the first board of selectmen and served in
that capacity for a long time; a juror in the Court of Assistants;
one of a committee to allot land for the inhabitants to plant on and
of another committee to allot land on the Neck and in East Boston;
one of a committee to erect fortifications on Fort Hill and its treasurer;
a member of the grand jury; a surveyor of the highways; a
constable. The full list of offices he held would be too long to
give here.</p>

<p class='c011'>He opened the first store in 1633 or 1634. It stood on Washington
Street opposite the Old State House, on the northeast corner.
Colonial records fail to state what class of goods our pioneer store-keeper
dealt in, or how long he conducted his shop, or whether he
made it a success, which I venture to predict, in view of his career,
he did.</p>

<p class='c011'>He proved himself a shrewd and energetic business man and became
wealthy for the times in which he lived. He was the proprietor
of a large amount of real estate, including two stores and half
an acre of land, which is now covered by the store of Houghton &amp;
Dutton, and corn mills in Charlestown and Malden.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was one of the builders of Long wharf, the oldest in Boston
and the one with the most interesting history. He served as sergeant
in that organization of, as somebody has facetiously dubbed
them, “bottle-scared veterans,” the Ancient and Honorable Artillery
Company.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Among his benefactions was a gift of 70 acres to Harvard College.
I might state in passing that Cogan was one of the settlers of Dorchester,
which colony was founded in the same year as was Boston,
1630, and lived there until his removal here in 1632.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some few weeks ago the daily papers chronicled the death of the
oldest alumnus of Harvard College and Boston’s oldest attorney.
This was Charles A. Welch of Cohasset, Mass. Welch was the descendant
of John Welch, who was recorded in Boston as a tax-payer
as early as 1682, and who wedded Elizabeth White. The distinguished
lawyer had as his great grandfather John Welch, who served
as commander of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company,
while the father of the lawyer was a noted wood carver and made the
famous codfish which adorns the State House and also the great
figure-head of Andrew Jackson which ornamented the bow of the
American frigate <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another descendant of this John Welch of colonial Boston, and
brother of the lawyer, was Edward H. Welch, who had the happiness
not only of returning to the church of his ancestors, but also
of becoming a member of the Society of Jesus. The lawyer and
priest numbered among their cousins the present Episcopalian
Bishop of Fond du Lac, the Right Reverend Charles C. Grafton;
and Mrs. Abbott, wife of the late Judge Abbott. In a word, John
Welch of colonial Boston was the progenitor of a distinguished
family.</p>

<p class='c011'>How many of you could tell me who made the first piano-forte
in America? And the first bass-viol? And the artificial leg with
joints? And the first pack of playing cards? If you don’t know, it
is not a matter of surprise, for those achievements are not chronicled
in our histories.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, I’ll tell you. There lived in Dorchester or Milton between
the years 1640 and 1650 a lad named Teague Crehore, who, it is
said, had been stolen from his parents in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of his descendants was Benjamin Crehore, who was born in
Milton. He was a remarkable genius. He it was who made the
first piano-forte in America, manufactured the first bass-viols and
invented the artificial leg with joints.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was Thomas Crehore, a nephew of Benjamin Crehore and
the son of William Crehore, a chair maker, and of the fifth generation
of Teague Crehore, who manufactured the first playing cards
in America.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Thomas Crehore was a native of Dorchester and born in 1769.
At the age of thirty-two he bought the land on which he built his
factory and house. The industry continued there (in Milton Lower
Mills, on the Neponset River, I believe) until 1846, when the factory
was burned down. Mr. Crehore died in the same year, leaving
a large estate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Crehores and John Cogan were not the only Kelts who were
business pioneers here in the early days. The first paper manufactured
in America was made in Dorchester and three Irishmen,
while not actually starting it, may be said to have been among the
founders and promoters of the industry (their predecessors having
for only a short time conducted it). These were Capt. James Boies,
Jeremiah Smith and Hugh McLean. Cullen in his <cite>Story of
the Irish in Boston</cite>, says: “If to Mr. Smith belonged the credit of
being the first individual paper manufacturer, to others of his countrymen
is due the fact that the Neponset River was made by them
the basis of paper manufacturing in the North American colonies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Boies was born in Ireland in 1702 and died in Milton at the age
of ninety-six years. He was with General Wolfe in the battle on
the Plains of Abraham. By direction of General Washington, Captain
Boies directed the work of transporting the fagots, in which
300 teams were engaged, that were used in fortifying Dorchester
Heights, following which event the British evacuated Boston.
Boies was one of a committee of three which drew up instructions
for the representatives of the town of Milton, wherein it was voted
that the colony would support the Continental Congress with their
lives and their fortunes in the event of hostilities with England.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jeremiah Smith was a native of Ireland and born in 1705. At
the age of twenty-one he came to Boston and in 1737 removed to
Milton. In that year he became superintendent of a paper industry
started by some men, including Thomas Hancock, a few years
before. Four years later he was its owner. He carried on the business
until 1775, when he retired, after amassing a fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>Smith was an intimate friend of Governor Hutchinson and also of
Governor Hancock, at whose hospitable board the wits of the day
were wont to gather. Smith was seldom absent on such occasions,
and if he were blessed with the characteristic Keltic wit, as presumably
he was, he must have added largely to the entertainment
of Hancock and his guests.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Hugh McLean, the third of the trio, was born in Ireland in 1724.
He married a daughter of Boies and while in partnership with him
became wealthy. He died in Milton at the age of seventy-five.</p>

<p class='c011'>Col. John C. Linehan, in his work <cite>The Irish Scots and the
“Scotch-Irish,”</cite> says: “Massachusetts had received, before the Revolution,
a fair proportion of the Irish, for which the race has received
but little credit.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The chronicles of the town of Boston,
Mass., are full of enactments to keep the Irish out, but it was found
to be impossible. They would come despite the prejudice, for
Massachusetts was the most progressive of the colonies, and these
people, or many of them, being artisans, spinners, weavers, shoemakers,
ropemakers, etc., their labor became welcome, and a compromise
was made by obliging those of them who were well-to-do to
furnish bonds for their poorer countrymen and women, to the end
that they would not become public charges.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And again: “As early as 1780 and 1790 John Sullivan, Patrick
Connor and Michael Carney were associated in the manufacture of
paper at Dorchester, Mass.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Properly speaking, I should not quote this statement in my paper,
as the dates mentioned are later than the limit of time with which
my subject treats; but I deemed it fitting to do so as being supplementary
to those facts given about the other three Kelts engaged in
the business.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the chaplains of the French fleet which assisted the Americans
in the Revolution was Abbe Robin. He wrote a series of letters
to a friend describing his travels in this country; the first, dated
in Boston, contained this paragraph:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Irish Presbyterians, discontented with their landlord at
home and attracted by similarity of sentiment, have established in
this place, with some success, manufactories of linen, and have made
some attempts at broadcloths; those that have been lately manufactured
are close and well woven, but hard and coarse; their hat
manufactories have succeeded not better than the cloths; they are
thick, spongy and without firmness, and come far short of the beauty
and solidity of ours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now it is fair to infer that these industries were not started since
the beginning of the Revolution. Those things are not done in
war-times for very obvious reasons. That they had been in operation
for some years may be taken for granted.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>And now here is evidence showing that one of these industries was
started a long time previous to the date of the Abbe’s letter. The
<cite>American Cyclopedia</cite> says: “Some of the Scotch-Irish settlers in
Boston in 1720 introduced the linen manufacture, which exercised
much interest and was greatly encouraged, spinning-schools being
established.” I didn’t know until I read this paragraph that there
was such an individual as a “Scotch-Irishman” in Boston in the early
days. The writers of the records never found one; or if they did,
failed to recognize him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now a word as to the alleged “Scotch-Irish” of early times in
Boston: Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary of the American-Irish
Historical Society, says on the subject:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Massachusetts colonial records repeatedly mention the
‘Irish,’ not the Scotch-Irish. Cotton Mather in a sermon in 1700
says: ‘At length it was proposed that a colony of Irish be sent over
to check the growth of this countrey.’ No prefix there&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cullen describes the arrival at Boston in 1717 of Captain Robert
Temple ‘with a number of Irish Protestants.’ Captain Temple was,
in 1740, elected to the Charitable Irish Society. In another place
Cullen alludes to ‘the Irish spinners and weavers who landed in
Boston in the early part of the eighteenth century.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the early citizens of Boston was William Hibbens, of Ireland,
who came here in 1634. Like his countryman, John Cogan,
he became prominent and wealthy. He was referred to in the colonial
records as a gentleman. He served for a long time on the
board of selectmen; as magistrate, agent of the colony in England,
treasurer of the town stock; deputy to the General Court; highway
surveyor; member of the commission to fortify Castle Island, and
in other offices also labored for the interests of his townsmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hibbens wedded Mrs. Ann Moore, a widow, and sister of Governor
Bellingham. He died in 1654. Mrs. Hibbens was hung for
alleged witchcraft two years later. She left her property to her
two sons, John and Joseph Moore, of Ballyhorick, County Cork, Ire.</p>

<p class='c011'>John Casey of Muddy River, as the now aristocratic town of
Brookline was called in early days, was a participant in that conflict
with the Indians known as King Philip’s War, fought in 1675–6.
He took part in the attack on the Red Men’s fort in the Great
Swamp in Rhode Island and was wounded in the engagement.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The name Collins is found frequently in the early records. Edward Collins was a resident of Cambridge as early as 1646. He
was a merchant. Christopher Collins, a shoemaker, lived in Dedham
as early as 1645. William Collins was in Boston as early as
1646. He was the New England agent of Mathew Craddock of
London, a merchant. John Collins became a “freeman” in 1646.
Timothy Collins, a servant, was brought to Boston in 1764 on a
schooner which came from Halifax and Cork. Four years later
came a lad set down in the records as William Collen, brought here
on a sloop from Windsor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ann Collins, a servant, arrived here from Ireland in 1767. Captain
Palfrey Collins came into port in 1768. Clement Collins was
one of a number of citizens who lodged their arms with the selectmen
in 1774. He gave up a gun and a blunderbuss. Joseph Collins,
on January 1, 1775, was nominated a watchman. In the
company of which Captain Allen was commander in 1698 was
Mathew Collins. In a public school kept here by Samuel Holyoke,
Daniel Collins was a pupil in 1753. Thomas Collins, a farmer,
came here in 1765 on a sloop from Fort Cumberland. John Collins
was a constable in 1657. Henry Collins was made a freeman
in 1636–7 and Edward Collins in 1640.</p>

<p class='c011'>Healy was another name of which I find mention on numerous
occasions in colonial days. William Healy, who was here as early
as 1645, figured in a number of real estate transactions and had
business dealings with Governor Dudley.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the leading Keltic families of colonial Boston was the
McCarthys. Thaddeus McCarthy was here as early as 1666. He
was an officer of the town in 1674 and a member of the Ancient
and Honorable Artillery Company in 1681.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of his sons, if I mistake not, was Florence McCarthy, who
became one of the leading citizens of the town, a man of wealth and
a successful dealer in provisions. He was one of the founders of
the first Episcopal church in New England. He was here as early
as 1686 and died in 1712. He left an estate valued at £2,922, including
his farm, which embraced the land in Roxbury on which the
Marcella Street Home stood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another son was Captain William McCarthy, who was the best
known ship-owner in the town. Still another was Thomas McCarthy.
He was chosen a constable in 1727, but was not anxious to
serve in that capacity. A fourth son was Thaddeus McCarthy, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>was graduated from Harvard College, was pastor of the First
Church in Worcester for thirty-seven years and became the father
of fifteen children.</p>

<p class='c011'>A brother of this Thaddeus McCarthy, the minister, was Captain
William McCarthy, who served as quartermaster of the Fifteenth
Massachusetts Regiment in the Revolution, and a son was Dr. Thaddeus
McCarthy, who became a noted medical practitioner in Fitchburg,
Mass., and Keene, N. H. A Charles Maccarty took part in
the expedition against Quebec in 1690 and was badly wounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>I will not vouch positively that I have stated accurately the relations
to one another of these Maccarthys. There is a little difference
in one or two statements in this matter by at least two good authorities,
Bernard Cullen, author of <cite>The Story of the Irish in Boston</cite>,
and the late Col. John C. Linehan of Concord, N. H., author of
numerous articles on the early Irish residents of New England.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now I am going to give you a few tid-bits, as it were, from the
colonial records and other sources:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Derman Mahoone is fined 20 shillings for intertaining two Irishwomen”
in 1657. In other words, he simply gave them the hospitality
of his home in a legitimate way. But that was against the
law—for the Irish.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Margaret Noriss, an Irishwoman is admitted to the town.” That
was in 1658.</p>

<p class='c011'>John Martin, a ship carpenter, was a resident in 1637 and was
admitted an inhabitant in the following year.</p>

<p class='c011'>John Moore was the servant of the governor in 1639.</p>

<p class='c011'>Myles Tarne, a leather dresser, was here as early as 1642.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the records of 1646 I quote: “John Berry is put an apprentice
to Edward Keyly for seaven years.” Berry, undoubtedly, is a
corruption of Barry, and Keyly of Kelly or Kiley.</p>

<p class='c011'>I hardly need to remind you, in mentioning this, that the spelling
of the keepers of the colonial records was something atrocious.
William Healy, to whom I referred a moment ago, had his name
spelled in at least five different ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>James Carey was chosen town clerk of Charlestown in 1662.</p>

<p class='c011'>A great fire occurred in Boston in 1760. Among those whose
homes were destroyed were Captain Killeran and Michael Carroll.
They lived in the district which we used to know as Fort Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1659 Governor Endicott united in marriage John Morrell and
Lysbell Morrell, both Irish, say the records.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>James Cochran, an Irish boy, was captured by Indians in those
early days. He was a brave youth and managed to kill a couple of
savages and make his escape. <cite>The Boston News-Letter</cite> of April 29,
1725, said of him: “James Cochran, ye youth that came into Brunswick
with two scalps, came into town on Monday last and on Tuesday
produced ye same scalps before ye Honorable Lieutenant-Governor
and Council, for which he received a reward of two hundred
pounds. And for ye farther encouragement of young men and
others to perform bold and hardy actions in ye Indian war, His
Honor ye Lieutenant Governor has been pleased to make him sargeant
in ye forces.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Verily, a good type of the Fighting Race!</p>

<p class='c011'>Now to come down to the second half of the period of time which
I am considering. One of the most picturesque and interesting
figures in the history of Boston was John Hancock, whom, some
claim, had Irish blood in his veins. He was a staunch patriot, statesman,
leader in public affairs, governor of the Commonwealth, orator
and the first signer of the Declaration of Independence (which, by
the way, with only his signature as president of the Continental Congress
and that of Charles Thomson, a native of Maghera, Ire., as
secretary, was sent forth to the world, the other names being added
to it later).</p>

<p class='c011'>As a bit of evidence which may help to indicate Hancock’s
ancestry, it may be worth mentioning that he presented a bell and
vane to the Irish Presbyterian Church in Boston.</p>

<p class='c011'>A copy of <cite>The Tyrone, Ireland, Constitution</cite>, issued some time in
or prior to 1876, contained these statements: “Those who are conversant
with <cite>Reid’s History of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</cite>
are aware that multitudes of Protestants left Ulster for the plantations
of North America. John Hancock’s ancestor was among that
number.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And again: “It is stated by reliable authorities that the ancestors
of John Hancock emigrated from near Downpatrick, Co. Down,
Ire., and settled in Boston toward the close of the seventeenth century.
The Hancocks have been for centuries actively and largely
engaged in the foreign and domestic trade of Newry, and it was,
doubtless, in a commercial capacity that the first of the name came
to Boston. The family to which President Hancock belonged is, it
is said, now (1889) represented in Ireland by John Hancock of Lurgan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and by Neilson Hancock, the founder of the Irish Statistical
Society. Anthony Hancock, who came from Ireland, resided in
Boston in 1681, and he was evidently the founder of the family in
America.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Equal to Hancock in patriotism and brilliant qualities was James
Sullivan, who spent the last part of his life in Boston. He was a
governor of Massachusetts, patriot, jurist, orator and author and
shone conspicuously in his various roles. He was a brother of General
John Sullivan, New Hampshire’s most distinguished Kelt,
patriot, the soldier who struck the first blow for the freedom of his
country, delegate to the Continental Congress, jurist and chief magistrate
of the Granite State.</p>

<p class='c011'>These two great men were the sons of Owen Sullivan or O’Sullivan,
who came from Ardea, Co. Kerry, while their mother was from
Cork.</p>

<p class='c011'>The year 1737 was notable in the annals of Boston as marking
the birth of a lad who was destined, up to the present time, to
become her greatest artist, “the American Vandyke,” as he was
fittingly called. He was a painter of portraits and historical subjects,
and doubtless many of you have seen some of the splendid
works from his brush which enrich the Museum of Fine Arts. I
refer to John Singleton Copley. He was the son of Irish parents
(they were from County Clare), who settled in Boston in 1736.</p>

<p class='c011'>Copley began his career under great disadvantages—without
teacher or instruction, without model, without materials to practise.
He even had to make his own palette and arrange what colors he
used. Furthermore, he never saw a good picture until he left his
native land. But notwithstanding all this, his genius triumphed.</p>

<p class='c011'>When twenty-three years old, Copley sent, without name or address,
an exquisite portrait of his half-brother, entitled “The Boy
and the Flying Squirrel,” to Benjamin West, the famous English
painter, requesting that it be placed in the exhibition rooms of the
Royal Academy in London. Though it was contrary to the rules
of that institution to give such an honor to the work of unknown
artists, this product of the young American Kelt was placed there
because of its merits and through West’s influence. West himself
made this comment on the painting: “What delicious coloring! It
is worthy of Titian himself!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Copley spent the latter part of his life in London, and after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>achieving the most brilliant success and receiving high honors, died
in 1815.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of his biographers assert that Copley left America because
of royalist tendencies, but this is untrue. He did so simply to perfect
himself in his art. As a matter of fact, his sympathies and
judgment were enlisted with his countrymen in their struggle for
independence, as passages in his own and friends’ correspondence
conclusively prove.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the Massachusetts men who signed the Declaration of
Independence was Robert Treat Paine of Boston. Paine, according
to what is believed to be good authorities, had Irish blood in his
veins. He was the grandson of Robert Paine, who came here about
the year 1698. This Robert Paine was a brother of Henry O’Neill
of Dungannon, Co. Tyrone, a descendant of Shane the Proud,
Prince of Ulster, and cousin of Sir Neal O’Neill, who perished in
the Battle of the Boyne. Henry O’Neill changed his name to
Paine, which had been borne by a parental ancestor, in order to
preserve part of his estates. So says O’Hart, compiler of <cite>Irish
Pedigrees</cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Robert Treat Paine, signer of the Declaration of Independence,
was born in Boston in 1731. He became a lawyer and conducted
the prosecution of the English soldiers who perpetrated the “Boston
Massacre,” as it is called. He served in the legislature and was
a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1778. When
the State Constitution of Massachusetts was adopted in 1780 he was
made attorney-general and served as such for six years, then becoming
a judge of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two of his descendants and namesakes are today prominent citizens
of Boston, one a successful business man, while the other, his
son, a few years ago was the candidate for governor on the Democratic
ticket.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first indication of the Irish in Boston giving any evidence of
national spirit occurred in 1737, on St. Patrick’s Day, when twenty-six
Protestant Kelts—they all belonged to the Irish Presbyterian
Church—organized the Charitable Irish Society to aid unfortunate
fellow countrymen and to cultivate a spirit of unity and harmony
among all Irishmen in the Massachusetts colony and their descendants
and to advance their interests socially and morally. It has
held meetings and celebrations from that day down to the present,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>except during the Revolution, in which a number of members took
part. It has the distinction of being the oldest Irish society in
America. Some of the charter members were the founders of
distinguished families.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the founders was Peter Pelham, stepfather of Copley, the
artist. He was an engraver, painter and father of fine arts. The
same year the society was founded the selectmen granted him permission
to open a school for the education of children in reading,
writing, needle-work, dancing and the art of painting on glass, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Major-General Henry Knox, that brilliant and dashing soldier of
the Revolution, and secretary of war, was also a member, as were his
father and two uncles. General Knox was born in Boston in 1760.</p>

<p class='c011'>The membership roll also contained the names of Capt. Robert
Gardner, a wealthy and prominent citizen; Rev. John Moorehead,
pastor of the Irish Presbyterian Church; William Hall, who was the
first president of the Society and was a constable in 1730; John
McLean, a slater, and who made repairs on Faneuil Hall; Captain
James McGee, who had command of a vessel in the service of the
commonwealth of Massachusetts Bay and which was wrecked during
a great storm in 1778, when seventy-two of the crew perished; and
William Moroney. The diary of Lieutenant Burton, published in
the Revolutionary rolls of New Hampshire, mentions the appointment
by Washington of Mr. Moroney as provost marshal of the
army.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the soldiers serving in the Revolution was the son of Mr.
Greaton, who kept the Greyhound Tavern in Roxbury. That boy
became known to fame as General John Greaton. He belonged to
the first company of minute men raised in America in 1775, and was
chosen major, lieutenant-colonel and colonel of Heath’s regiment.
After the battle of Lexington he was engaged in the skirmishes
about Boston until he joined that memorable excursion to Quebec.
He served throughout our struggle for independence and was one of
Washington’s most trusted officers.</p>

<p class='c011'>William Connolly was another Boston Kelt who fought in the
Revolution. And so was Michael Cassady. Cassady was one of
the patriots at Valley Forge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the residents of Milton in colonial days was Anthony Gulliver,
who was born in Ireland in 1619. He was the ancestor of a
large number of able and influential men and women who have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>prominent in public and religious affairs of Milton, Mass., for nearly
two centuries.</p>

<p class='c011'><cite>The Story of the Irish in Boston</cite> contains the following interesting
paragraph about a member of the Gulliver family:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Capt. Lemuel Gulliver, who once lived at Algerine Corner, returned
to Ireland in 1723 and gave a glowing description of the
American country to his neighbor, Jonathan Swift. Lemuel’s imagination
was vivid and fanciful and he turned it to a quaint account
in this instance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He declared to Swift that ‘the frogs were as tall as his knees and
had musical voices that were guitar-like in their tones; the mosquitoes’
bills were as long as darning needles’; and from these exaggerated
and fabulous accounts of the country the great Swift conceived
and wrote the famous <cite>Gulliver’s Travels</cite>, which was published
in 1726, displaying a unique union of misanthropy, satire, irony,
ingenuity and humor.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CONCERNING “AN IRISH MAN-OF-WAR.”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Further information is wanted regarding the following incident
mentioned in <cite>Winthrop’s History of New England</cite>: “A ship from
the Colonies, carrying fourteen guns&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* on a voyage to
the Canaries about the close of the year 1644, fought nearly all
day at close quarters, and finally beat off an Irish man-of-war of

  <h2 class='c004'>AN EARLY DOUGHERTY MENTIONED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Boston <cite>Evening Transcript</cite> recently had the following:
“Dougherty. Lieutenant Charles Dougherty removed to Framingham
from Brookfield about 1765. When was he born and who were

</div>

<p class='c005'>Hon. John D. Crimmins of New York City, in one of his books
speaks of John Michael O’Conor. The latter was a native of New
York; lieutenant in the Third U. S. Artillery, 1812; later, regimental
quartermaster; was made captain in the spring of 1813;
June 20, 1814, he was appointed assistant adjutant-general under
Gardner, on Gen. Brown’s staff, and held the rank at the time of
the battle of Chippewa, in which he participated. He left the
army in 1821. He translated, in 1824, for the U. S. Military Academy
at West Point, Guy de Vernon’s <cite>Science of War and Fortifications</cite>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The society some time ago received an interesting letter of inquiry
from Mrs. M. A. Mulcahy, residing at Jack’s Reef, Onondaga
County, New York. She wrote concerning a granduncle, who
served in the Revolution. His name was Flynn, and he came from
the County Galway in Ireland. Dying, he left a will depositing
certain money in the United States treasury. The heirs never received
any of it. Mrs. Mulcahy wished to ascertain the proper
steps to take to recover the same.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY HON. A. L. MORRISON, SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As Monday will be the anniversary of New Orleans, I thought I
would send you the inclosed letter from General Jackson [who was
of Irish parentage], which will help you to celebrate the great event.
The introduction is somewhat mutilated, but you can get enough
from it to serve as an introduction to the letter. A number of
years ago I visited New Orleans, and I need not tell you that one of
my most pleasant recollections of the visit was inspecting the field
where 1,500 Kentucky and Tennessee riflemen killed or wounded
2,117 of England’s choicest troops, including their commander, General
Pakenham, who was brother-in-law of the Iron Duke.</p>

<p class='c011'>I saw while on the field an unfinished monument in honor of the
brave men who won the battle. I made all the inquiries possible
about the monument (which I regarded as a monument of ingratitude),
but could find no one who could give me any information
concerning it. I even wrote to the <cite>Picayune</cite> suggesting that as the
exposition to celebrate the Louisiana Purchase was about to be held,
the event would be a good opportunity to raise the funds necessary
to finish the monument, but nothing was done and it still remains
as a reproach to the last generation as well as to this.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course you know that the treaty of Ghent was signed on Christmas
Day, 1814, so it was three weeks after that that the battle was
fought; but it came in time to redeem the series of blunders that
characterized the so-called campaign on the Canadian frontier. In
this connection permit me to say that the house we live in was
bought from a gentleman whose two grandfathers were present at
the battle. I knew a man when I was a boy who fought on the
British side, and also fought on the fatal field of Waterloo, in the
Twenty-seventh Inniskillen Foot.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Following are the excerpts from General Jackson’s letter to which
Mr. Morrison alludes above:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The battle (says General Jackson) commenced at a very little
before 7 a. m., January 8, 1815, and as far as the infantry was concerned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>it was over by 9 a. m. My force was very much mixed. I
had portions of the 7th and 44th regular infantry regiments, Kentucky
and Tennessee riflemen, Creoles, United States marines and
sailors, Baratarian men—one of them, Captain Dominique You,
commanded part of my artillery (and a famous gunner he was)—and
two battalions of free negroes. I had in the action about 6,000
men. The British strength was almost the same as mine, but vastly
superior in drill and discipline. Of their force my riflemen killed
and wounded 2,117 in less than an hour, including two general officers
(both died on the field, each a division commander), seven full
colonels, with seventy-five line and staff officers. I lost six killed
and seven wounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As to tactics, there were very little in use on either side. We
had some works of earth fronting the river, but the Kentucky and
Tennessee riflemen, who sustained the main attack, had protected
themselves by a work about two feet and a half high, made of logs
placed two feet apart, and the space between filled in with earth.
This work began at the Mississippi River, and ended in the swamp,
being at a right angle with the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thinking this the weakest portion of our line, and seeing ununiformed
men behind the trifling defenses, General Pakenham
thought it the best thing to begin his attack by carrying this part
of my line with the bayonet. On the 3d of January I had ordered
that each rifleman’s powder-horn be filled, and enough lead for 100
bullets issued, besides good material for bullet-patching be furnished.
This order required every soldier to thoroughly clean his
rifle and put a new flint into the hammer; so we were ready as we
could be for the attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a very heavy fog on the river that morning, and the
British had formed and were moving before I knew it. The disposition
of the riflemen was very simple. They were told off in numbers
one and two. Number one was to fire first, then step back and
let number two shoot while he reloaded. About six hundred yards
from the riflemen there was a great drainage canal running back
from the Mississippi River to the swamp in the rear of the tilled
land on which we were operating. Along this canal the British
formed under the fire of the few artillery pieces I had, near enough
to them to get their range. But the instant I saw them I said to
Coffee, whom I directed to hurry to his line, which was to be first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>attacked: ‘By ——, we have got them; they are ours!’ Coffee
dashed forward, and riding along his line, called out, ‘Don’t shoot
till you can see their belt-buckles.’ The British were formed in
mass, well closed up, and about two companies front.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The British, thus formed, moved on at a quick step, without
firing a shot, to within one hundred yards of the kneeling riflemen,
who were holding their fire till they could see the belt-buckles of
their enemies. The British advance was executed as though they
had been on parade. They marched shoulder to shoulder, with the
step of veterans, as they were. At one hundred yards’ distance from
our line the order was given, ‘Extend column front. Double quick,
march! Charge!’ With bayonets at the charge, they came on us
at a run. I own it was an anxious moment; I well knew the charging
column was made up of the picked troops of the British army.
They had been trained by the duke himself, were commanded by his
brother-in-law, and had successfully held off the ablest of Napoleon’s
marshals in the Spanish campaign. My riflemen had never
seen such an attack, nor had they ever before fought white men.
The morning, too, was damp; their powder might not burn well.
‘God help us!’ I muttered, watching the rapidly advancing line.
Seventy, sixty, fifty, finally forty yards were they from the silent
kneeling riflemen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All of my men I could see was their long rifles rested on the logs
before them. They obeyed their orders well; not a shot was fired
until the redcoats were within forty yards. I heard Coffee’s voice as
he roared out: ‘Now, men, aim for the center of the cross-belts! Fire!’
A second after the order a crackling, blazing flash ran all along
our line. The smoke hung so heavily in the misty morning air that
I could not see what had happened. I called Tom Overton and
Abner Duncan, of my staff, and we galloped towards Coffee’s line.
In a few seconds after the first fire there came another sharp, ringing
volley. As I came within one hundred and fifty yards of Coffee,
the smoke lifted enough for me to make out what was happening.
The British were falling back in a confused, disorderly mass, and
the entire first ranks of their column were blown away. For two
hundred yards in our front the ground was covered with a mass of
writhing wounded, dead and dying redcoats.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the time the rifles were wiped the British line was reformed,
and on it came again. This time they were led by General Pakenham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>in person, gallantly mounted, and riding as though he was on
parade. Just before he got within range of Coffee’s line, I heard
a single rifle-shot from a group of country carts we had been using,
about one hundred and seventy-five yards distant, and a moment
thereafter I saw Pakenham reel and pitch out of his saddle. I have
always believed he fell from the bullet of a free man of color, who
was a famous rifle-shot, and came from the Atakappas region of
Louisiana. The second advance was precisely like the first in its
ending. In five volleys the 1,500 or more riflemen killed and
wounded 2,117 British soldiers, two thirds of them killed dead or
mortally wounded. I did not know where General Pakenham was
lying, or I should have sent to him, or gone in person, to offer any
service in my power to render.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was told he lived two hours after he was hit. His wound was
directly through the liver and bowels. General Keene, I hear, was
killed dead. They sent a flag to me, asking leave to gather up their
wounded and bury their dead, which, of course, I granted. I was
told by a wounded officer that the rank and file absolutely refused
to make a third charge. ‘We have no chance with such shooting as
these Americans do,’ they said.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Commenting on the letter, and after referring to Napoleon’s expressions
of admiration for the American leader’s action at New
Orleans, William Hugh Roberts, the noted writer, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This concludes the material part of General Jackson’s letter.
It was in the feverish glories of the Hundred Days that Napoleon
came into possession of Mr. Monroe’s translation. There was no
doubt about the facts. There happened to be abroad then in France
two or three American gentlemen who were accustomed to the use
of the rifle. One of them selected a weapon out of the four sent
from America to the French emperor, and in Napoleon’s presence
did some really excellent sharpshooting at one hundred yards.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had Napoleon won Waterloo, it is possible that he would have
organized a corps of sharpshooters and armed them with the American
rifle, which was capable of a more deadly accuracy than any
European arm of the kind, not excepting even the rifle of Switzerland.
General Jackson repeated the compliment of Napoleon to
the typical American weapon to General William Selby Harney,
then a field officer of dragoons, who in turn related the incident to
the writer.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ANENT THE SHANNON FAMILY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Eleanor Lexington, in the <cite>Buffalo Sunday News</cite>, states that Nathaniel
Shannon, who was born in Ireland 1655, came to this country
when he was thirty-two years old and made his home in Boston,
where in 1701 he was a member of the Old South Church. Twenty-two
years later he died, and the stone marking his grave in the Old
Granary Burying Ground in Boston is still standing. Nathaniel’s
brother, Robert, was mayor of Derry in 1689, and Nathaniel was
also a man of affairs, holding many town offices. He was the first
naval officer of the port of Boston and a merchant of prominence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The papers now preserved in the Massachusetts State Archives
show that he was a man of good education. His wife was Elizabeth,
and their children were Nathaniel J., Robert, who is supposed to
have died unmarried, and Samuel, who married Ann Miller. Nathaniel
the second married Abigail Vaughan, whose father was one
of the royal councillors and also chief justice of New Hampshire.
Nathaniel and Abigail had two sons, Nathaniel and Cutts. The four
children of Nathaniel were his namesake, and George, Margaret
and Abigail. Nathaniel and his wife, Abigail Vaughan, lived in
Portsmouth, N. H., where he was a ship merchant. He also lived
in Ipswich. Among other records of this generation, still extant,
is that of a deed conveying land to Jonathan Belcher, 1720. Nathaniel
was a slave owner, and, by will, left negroes to his sons.</p>

<p class='c011'>We find that Dover, N. H., was another stronghold of the Shannons,
and Thomas, who married Lilias Watson, held many town
offices. In 1785 he was captain of the New Hampshire militia.
“He was a zealous supporter of the Revolution and active in recruiting
its armies.” He died in 1800, aged about fifty years.
Heitman’s <cite>Officers of the American Revolution</cite> names William
Shannon of Virginia, ensign and lieutenant. O’Seanchain is said
to have been the first form of the surname, Shannon. From O’Seanchain
to Shanahan, Shanason, is considered an easy feat to accomplish
by those who are skilled in such matters. Then from Shanahan
to Shanon or Shannon is as easy as rolling off the proverbial
log. Seanchain or Seanchan is composed of two Celtic words,
“seancha,” meaning an antiquarian or genealogist, and “an,” one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>who. Seanchan is, then, one who is an antiquarian. Old records
frequently give the name as Shanon, or with one “n.” The O’Sheanchains
have a long pedigree, belonging, as they do, to that branch
of the Celtic race which alone of all European races of the period
antedating the Christian era has maintained its identity to the present
time.</p>

    <dd>Hon. John D. Crimmins has sold today a collection of autographs and literary treasures.

    The sale attracted much interest. Death of Col. Frances E. Lacey, a retired officer of 
    the U. S. A., who had been residing with his son in New York City. Colonel Lacey served 
    with distinction throughout the Civil War, with the Second Infantry, and participated in 
    many great battles. He remained in the service at the reorganization in 1866, and was 
    transferred to the Tenth Infantry, in which organization <span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>he remained for 
    twenty-seven years, being the ranking officer in point of service in the regiment. He was 
    then a major and assigned to the Seventeenth Infantry, and was at Columbus barracks. 
    Major Lacey was in Columbus for two and one-half years from 1895. He was later made a 
    lieutenant-colonel of the Third Infantry and retired in 1897 as a colonel on pay. Colonel 
    Lacey was born in Limerick, Ireland, in 1833. He came to Columbus while a young man in 
    time to join the forces of the Union. He was full of pluck and energy and made a model 
    soldier. His promotions came rapidly. Colonel Lacey leaves three sons and one daughter, 
    George B., who resides in Columbus; R. E., who resides in Columbus; Captain Francis E., 
    of the First Infantry, now in the Philippines; Mrs. F. S. Cuchen, wife of Captain Cuchen 
    of Governor’s Island. Interment was made at the National Cemetery, Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

    Tuesday a resolution asking Mayor McClellan to see what can be done through the United 
    States Department of State toward recovering from the British government part of the 
    records of the City Fathers of proceedings in the Revolutionary period, and which 
    the <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>British took with them when they evacuated New York. Mr. McGowan has 
    learned that the aldermanic records for that period are all that are required to make 
    complete the city’s record of the legislative work done by the municipal authorities. 
    There is a record showing that the missing papers were taken away by the English, and Mr. 
    McGowan believes that if the British authorities were asked to return them they would 
    either do so or would at least permit a copy of them to be made.”

    It was the anniversary of the departure of the regiment for the seat of war on April 23, 
    1861. There were about 250 men in the banquet hall, but it was a matter of comment that 
    the great majority of these were young men. The veterans were there, what are left of 
    them. The first hearty applause of the evening was given when Lieut.Gov. 
    <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Chanler entered the room. Awaiting him at the guest table were Borough President 
    Patrick F. McGowan, Senator John P. Cohalan, the Rev. Dr. David G. Wylie, Rev. Father 
    Chidwick, Magistrate Matthew P. Breen and his son, Henry J. Breen, Col. Edward Duffy, 
    Justice John Henry McCarthy, Thomas J. Byrne, William F. Baker, president of the civil 
    service board; Thomas E. Crimmins and Magistrates Baker and Walsh. There were others, too.

    carriages, seven of which are at Fort McHenry and three at Fort Delaware. General Leary

    <dd>Mayor McClellan of New York City writes as follows: May 6, 1907. To the Honorable, the 
    Board of Aldermen of the City of New York: Gentlemen:—It is my duty to inform your 
    honorable body, for such action as you may deem fitting, of the death of Patrick Keenan, 
    chamberlain of the city of New York. For seven consecutive terms a member of your 
    honorable body, once your presiding officer, once clerk of the county of New York, and 
    thrice chamberlain of the city, Mr. Keenan enjoyed public confidence to an extent 
    attained by few men. He died in the fulness of man’s allotted years, with no tarnish on 
    the honor he prized so much, and with only words of grief and praise from the friends who 
    venerated him and the citizens he faithfully served. It is my privilege thus to express 
    my sorrow at the loss of a friend whose conduct rewarded the trust I twice had the honor 
    to repose in him.

    <dd>A telegram published today states that a turret accident on board the battleship 
    <i>Connecticut</i>, similar to those on the <i>Georgia</i> and several other of the U. S. 
    big fighting ships, was averted by the presence of mind and heroism of Lieut. William 
    Pigott Cronan, has just come to light through the summoning of a board of inquiry at the 
    New York navy yard. According to the story, Lieutenant Cronan was in command of one of 
    the eight-inch guns on the <i>Connecticut</i> during recent target practice off New 
    England. As the powder charge was thrust into the gun, the lieutenant noticed that from a 
    small hole in the bag a quantity of powder had escaped and fallen into the threads into 
    which the breech-block of the gun screws. Realizing that the action of screwing the 
    breach-block back home would ignite the powder before the block could be firmly screwed 
    home, causing the entire charge to explode back into the turret, Lieutenant Cronan 
    shouted an order which stopped every man in the turret, as he stood, except the man who 
    was closing the breech of the gun. He did not hear the shout and continued to swing the 
    block home. Lieutenant Cronan sprang forward and thrust his hand into the breech of the 
    gun. The breech closed on his hand, badly mangling it and cleanly cutting off the first 
    finger, which fell into the grooves and caused the closing mechanism to clog. The 
    sailor <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>at the breech of the gun fainted when he discovered what he had done and 
    what he had narrowly escaped doing. If the breech had been closed it is likely that every 
    man in the turret would have been killed. The board of inquiry was called to determine 
    how the hole came into the powder bag. Cronan is a son of Patrick J. Cronan of New Haven. 
    During the war with Spain, Lieutenant Cronan was highly commended for several acts of 
    bravery. The following is another account: While the battleship <i>Connecticut</i> was 
    engaged in target practice off Cape Cod last week, Lieutenant William P. Cronan 
    undoubtedly prevented a repetition of the fatal explosion on the <i>Georgia</i> by 
    staying the closing of the breech of the eight-inch barker in the after turret by 
    inserting his fingers in the breech grooves just as the heavy butt of metal was swinging 
    into place. When they swung back the breech-block the fragments of his first and second 
    fingers, severed at the first joint, were found ground into the grooves. The 
    <i>Connecticut</i> had joined the rest of the squadron in target practice off Cape Cod 
    last week and all of the eight-inch guns were being worked. The firing was fast, it being 
    a part of the test that the guns should be fired as rapidly and as accurately as 
    possible, and in order to outdo the sailors on the other ships that were engaged in the 
    practice, the <i>Connecticut’s</i> men were working hard to load, train and fire the four 
    big tubes in the starboard and port turrets. The eight men working under command of 
    Lieutenant Cronan in the aft starboard turret were swinging to their task like pieces of 
    mechanism in a single machine. Two men worked the powder hoist from the magazines below, 
    two swabbed out the gun after each shot, two lifted the bags of powder into the breech 
    after the heavy shell had been placed, and one man swung back and locked the breech for 
    the firing. It was bang! and in an instant the breech was open and the men were sucking 
    in the powder fumes while they swabbed and hoisted and charged the big gun for another 
    shot. The <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>gun got so hot that it was difficult to place a hand on the breech 
    without blistering it. The men with the water swabs kept the temperature down to the 
    safety point inside the chamber, but even at that it was almost hot enough to flash 
    powder and a little friction would have been enough to set off any spare grains.

    <dd>A dispatch from Durham, N. H., which was published in the Boston <cite>Herald</cite> 
    today, reads as follows: (Special Dispatch to the <cite>Sunday Herald</cite>.) Durham, N. 
    H., Nov. 9.—For some years there has been a movement to restore the burial place of 
    Maj.-Gen. John Sullivan, who died in Durham January 23, 1795. This labor of love, shared 
    by many prominent people both in and out of Durham, is now completed. A substantial wall 
    has been erected around the little cemetery, the lot has been cleared and graded, the 
    gravestones reset and iron gates provided at the entrance. As marking the end of this 
    labor, a Sullivan commemoration service has been planned for next Monday afternoon, and 
    an invitation to attend the ceremonies is extended to all who cherish the dead general’s 
    memory. Descendants of General Sullivan, members of the Grand Army posts and various 
    historical societies and many others have already signified their intention of being 
    present. The program will include an oration by the Rev. William Elliot Griffis, D. D., 
    of Ithaca, N. Y., a celebrated authority on matters pertaining to General Sullivan. The 
    faculty of the New Hampshire State College have volunteered to suspend college exercises 
    during the ceremonies, and the student battalion and college brass band <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>will 
    perform escort duty. The procession will start from the Congregational Church at 2.30 
    o’clock, proceeding to the cemetery, where the exercises will be held. The oration will 
    be delivered at the church immediately afterward. The house General Sullivan occupied 
    will be open for inspection by visitors during the day, also every department of the 
    state college and its work, in which institution patriotism for present day needs is 
    being nurtured.

<p class='c005'>The following members of the Society died during the year 1907,
much and deservedly regretted:</p>

<h3 class='c006'>Rt. Rev. WILLIAM STANG. D.D.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Fall River, Mass., died
February 2, at St. Mary’s Hospital, Rochester, Minn. He was born
at Langenbruchen, Baden-Baden, Germany, on April 21, 1854. His
early education was received in the German Gymnasia, but as he
had chosen the career of a missionary, he made his theological studies
in the American College at Louvain, Belgium, and was there ordained
to the priesthood, on June 15, 1878. After a brief service
as professor in his Alma Mater, he came to the United States in
1879, and was accepted by the late Bishop Hendricken into the diocese
of Providence, R. I. He adopted his new country in wholehearted
fashion. In 1884, Father Stang was appointed rector of
St. Anne’s Church, Cranston, R. I. He became rector of the
Providence Cathedral, and held that important charge until 1895,
when he returned to Louvain, to serve his church and country as
vice-rector of the American College for a term of three years. Back
to Providence in 1898, he organized and headed the Providence
apostolate—a band of missionary priests organized especially for
missions to non-Catholics. He was also rector of St. Edward’s
Church for three years, and then chancellor, until the division of
the diocese of Providence in 1904, and his appointment to the new
diocese of Fall River. Bishop Stang was consecrated in the Providence
Cathedral during the same year, on May 1. He managed to
combine the arduous ordinary work of the priesthood with the special
work of the continuous student and author. Almost from the first
year of his priesthood he was writing for the Catholic magazines
and bringing out books. His published works, the last of which
was brought out since his consecration, are: “The Life of Martin
Luther,” “The Eve of the Reformation,” “More About the Huguenots,”
“Germany’s Debt to Ireland,” “Pastoral Theology,” “Historiographia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Ecclesiastica,” “The Business Guide for Priests,” “Theologia
Fundamentalis Moralis,” “The Devil, Who He Is,” “Spiritual
Pepper and Salt,” and “Socialism and Christianity.” His last magazine
article, “Father Denifle and His Great and Lasting Work,”
appeared in the <cite>American Ecclesiastical Review</cite> for January, 1907.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>JOHN B. SULLIVAN</h3>

<p class='c015'>of New Bedford, Mass. He died there February 9. Mr. Sullivan
was born in Castletown, County Cork, June 24, 1847, the son of
Timothy and Honora (Harrington) Sullivan. He received a common
school education in his native town and in 1867 came to this
country and settled in New Bedford. He learned the stone mason’s
trade, at which he worked until 1882, when he began contracting
and building. The latter business he pursued with conspicuous success
up to the time of his death, being associated for a number of
years past with his son, Mark E. Sullivan. A number of noteworthy
New Bedford buildings have been erected by Mr. Sullivan.
Among them are St. Mary’s Home, St. Lawrence’s presbytery, the
Holy Family School, the tower of St. Lawrence’s Church, St. James’
Church, St. Mary’s Chapel, the Park Hotel, No. 8 Engine House,
the Connell block on Purchase St., the Dawson building and the
addition to St. Joseph’s Hospital. He built several schoolhouses
for the city, and on the second set of plans for the high school was
the lowest bidder. His firm secured the contract for finishing St.
Anthony’s Church. Besides a large number of public buildings,
Mr. Sullivan was an extensive builder of houses in the north part of
the city. He carried on a stone quarry in addition to his building
business. Mr. Sullivan was a trustee of St. Lawrence parish, a
member of and one of the organizers of the Master Builders’ Association,
and a member of the New Bedford Board of Trade, the
Plymouth Club and Holy Name Society of St. Lawrence Church.
In August, 1872, he married Miss Margaret Sullivan, who died,
leaving one son, Mark E. By his second wife, who was Katherine
E. Sullivan, he had two children, Mary and Frank.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>OSBORNE HOWES.</h3>

<p class='c015'>He was a descendant of David O’Killia, who settled on Cape
Cod, Mass., as early as 1657. Osborne Howes was born in Boston
in 1846 and was educated in private and public schools of the city.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Soon after his graduation he entered the service of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company on the steamers of that line running between
Panama, San Francisco and Hongkong. After three years thus
spent on the Pacific coast, he went to New York City and there began
a connection with newspaper work which continued almost up to the
time of his death. Beginning in the office of the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>,
he was afterward employed by the <cite>New York Times</cite>, serving on that
paper during its exposé of the “Tweed ring.” In 1873 he accepted
the position of secretary of the Boston board of fire underwriters, and
was always thereafter identified with that body. Having resumed
his residence in Boston, he was appointed from time to time to various
public offices. As representative of the board of underwriters he
was instrumental in having that board take action upon several important
public questions. The resolution committing the associated
board of trade to the principle that all future subways in Boston
should be built under such conditions that they would ultimately
revert to the city, was drawn up, presented and urged by him, and
as a result of its adoption the Boston Associated Board of Trade
was the foremost opponent on this question of excessive corporate
demands. As a member of the Boston Chamber of Commerce, Mr.
Howes was chairman of its committee on the Isthmian canal, and
vice-chairman of its committee on reciprocal trade relations with
Canada. In this latter connection he addressed the boards of trade
and chambers of commerce, not only of a number of the cities of
New England, but those of New York, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Indianapolis
and other cities of the West. In 1891, feeling convinced
that it was desirable that public action should be taken toward educating
young men to become competent seamen, he prepared, introduced
and succeeded in having the legislature adopt a bill creating
the Nautical Training School, which the commonwealth now maintains
on board the U. S. S. <i>Enterprise</i>. From 1875 to 1877, inclusive,
Mr. Howes was a member of the common council of Boston,
representing the South End ward, in which he then resided. In
1886 he moved his residence to the town of Brookline, and besides
serving on various town committees, became a member of the rapid
transit commission, to which he was appointed by Governor Russell;
also a member of the metropolitan district (Greater Boston) commission,
to which he was appointed by Governor Greenhalge. In
1884 Mr. Howes was a member of the special committee of fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>which prepared the new Boston city charter; he also served as one
of the trustees of the public library. Mr. Howes in 1901, and again
in 1902, was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the state
senate in the second Norfolk district, but was defeated on both occasions.
On the first occasion, in his letter of acceptance, he described
the state platform of the Democratic party as “an attempt
to bring back the government machinery of the commonwealth to
something approaching the simplicity of its earlier days.” On the
second he championed “more liberal and advantageous trade relations
between New England and Canada.” In 1904 Mayor Collins
appointed him to an unsalaried position as member of the board of
building inspection. The following year Mr. Howes took a leading
part as chairman of the committee on resolutions in preparing the
platform of the Democratic party in the state contest. Mr. Howes
was Japanese consul in Boston at the time of his death, which sad
event took place April 9.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>PETER McDONNELL.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Born in Ireland, died aboard the White Star steamer <i>Oceanic</i>, in
August, while returning from Ireland. Mr. McDonnell first came
to this country when a young man. For a long time he had represented
the railroads successfully at Castle Garden, the Barge Office
and Ellis Island. He was also interested in the steamship business
at the immigration station and carried on a big banking business at
No. 2 Battery Place. When he went to his old home in Ireland in
the spring he was in poor health. He was accompanied by his wife
and one of his six sons. Mr. McDonnell was the secretary and a
director of the Columbia Oil Company of New York, one of the
few rivals of the Standard Oil Company, and a director of the New
York Mortgage and Securities Company. He was a member of the
Catholic Club and for many years of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick.
When President Roosevelt was the guest of the latter organization
in 1905, it will be remembered the birth of Mr. McDonnell’s
grandson, which was announced at the dinner, was one of the features
of the occasion.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>JOHN B. SHEA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Born in Kenmare, Ireland, 1835; he came to this country when
he was seven years of age. He died late in 1907. Mr. Shea was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>very successful in business. He went to work for Andrew Berrian,
a pen manufacturer, in 1849, and after being employed by Bard
Bros. of Philadelphia, Alexander Morton and Leroy W. Fairchild,
he entered the factory of Aikin, Lambert &amp; Co., the Maiden Lane,
New York, jewelers, as foreman. In 1869 he was admitted to partnership,
and when the concern was incorporated, he became its vice-president,
which position he held up to the time of his death. Mr.
Shea never married and is survived by a sister, Mary, and a brother,
Michael. He was a brother of the late Denis Shea, clothier of
Broome and Crosby streets, who was the Republican district leader
of the Second district from early in the 90s, until his death, about
three years ago. John B. Shea was his trustee.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>Rt. Rev. Mgr. THOMAS H. WALLACE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>He was born in Somersworth, N. H. He died in Lewiston, Me.,
November 1. After finishing his course in the Somersworth High
School, he graduated in 1864, entered Holy Cross College, Worcester,
Mass., and carried off the highest honors of his class at his
graduation in June, 1868. In the following September he entered
the Theological Seminary of St. Sulpice, Montreal. He was ordained
priest by the first bishop of Portland, the Rt. Rev. David
William Bacon, D. D., in the Cathedral, Portland, Me., August 5,
1871. After his ordination he was first sent as assistant to the pastor
at Waterville, whose parish included twelve or fifteen missions.
Here the young priest began his mission work and displayed
that tireless energy and zeal that gave promise of his future success.
In 1872 he was transferred to St. Dominic’s Church in Portland
to assist the Rev. Eugene M. O’Callaghan, who is now the Rt. Rev.
Monseigneur, and vicar general of the diocese of Manchester, N. H.
The careers of both priests have been very similar, each of them
receiving the purple in 1905. Father Wallace succeeded Father
O’Callaghan as rector of St. Dominic’s and to this day both are
most lovingly remembered by the old members of the parish. In
August, 1876, Father Wallace was appointed rector of St. Joseph’s,
Lewiston, which has been the scene of his labors for the past thirty-one
years. He found St. Joseph’s with a debt which he set to work
at once to pay off. In March, 1880, he purchased the Bonallie
Block on Main Street. He remodelled this block and fitted it for a
school for the girls of the parish at an expense of $30,000. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>placed the school under the charge of the nuns of Notre Dame from
Montreal. In 1886 he purchased the fine property at the corner of
Bates and Walnut streets, at a cost of $25,000. This lot fronts on
the City Park and is the most beautiful site for a church in the
state. He began work at once on the foundation of the church and
on June 24, 1887, the corner stone was laid by the lamented Bishop
Healy, with appropriate ceremonies. The dedication sermon was
preached by the Rt. Rev. Thomas J. Conaty, D. D., who is now
bishop of Monterey and Los Angeles, Cal. The first mass in the
sacred edifice was celebrated in 1890.</p>

<p>HON. FELIX CARBRAY, M. R. I. A.,<br /><br />A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY, RECENTLY DECEASED.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h3 class='c006'>Hon. FELIX CARBRAY, M. R. I. A.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A native of Quebec, born in 1835. He died in Quebec in December,
1907. His parents were from the County Tyrone, Ireland,
and came to Canada in the early 30s. The father, Niall Carbray,
was born at Carrickcastle, near Dungannon. The old Carbray homestead
still exists there and is occupied by a member of the family.
His mother was Catherine Connolly, a native of Clogher, County
Tyrone. Felix, the son, subject of this sketch, was educated at private
schools and at the Christian Brothers, in his native city. Endowed
with natural talents of no ordinary character and with a
thirst for knowledge, he applied himself earnestly in the effort to
improve his education in every possible way. He distinguished
himself in mathematics and literature. He was endowed with a
great aptitude for the acquisition of foreign languages, and was
familiar with the Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French. He
was as thoroughly familiar with French as with English. Thus
well equipped with a superior education and a worthy ambition to
make his mark in life, he began a business course in April, 1854,
as an accountant, which he continued in some of the leading houses
in his native city for fifteen years. In May, 1869, he opened an
office as a general commission and shipping merchant, which from
the beginning was most successful. In the spring of 1870, he took
as partner, Francis Routh, son of the late Sir Randolph Routh.
His mother was a Taschereau, sister of the late Cardinal Taschereau
and of the late Chief Justice Taschereau. The new firm, Carbray
&amp; Routh, which a few years later became Carbray, Routh
&amp; Co., opened an office also in Montreal, Mr. Carbray managing
the business of the Quebec office and Mr. Routh that of the Montreal office. The new firm had a long, prosperous and honorable
career. No firm was more widely known all over the business world,
nor did any stand higher for integrity and honor. The partnership,
having expired in 1900, was dissolved and the affairs liquidated;
this being found to the mutual advantage of the associates.
Mr. Carbray continued the business at Quebec with his son, William,
under the name of Carbray, Son &amp; Co., and Mr. Routh that of
Montreal under the style of F. A. Routh &amp; Co. Both firms have
been very successful and bid fair to go on down the generations like
many of the old houses of Europe. The high character and abilities
of Felix Carbray at an earlier date attracted the attention of his
fellow citizens, and every mark of esteem and confidence was shown
him. He loved Ireland, the land of his fathers, with an intense
love, and threw himself heart and soul into every movement tending
to promote her cause or the welfare of his race. No Irishman of
his time in Quebec did more to raise the prestige of the Irish race
and the cause of Ireland among the peoples of other races.
In 1883, <cite>Redpath’s Weekly</cite> says of Mr. Carbray: “He is a
gentleman of high culture and deep learning. His linguistic attainments
are also remarkable. He speaks the French and English
languages with equal fluency, and as both are used in the Quebec
legislature, Mr. Carbray addresses the house in one or the other
with equal elegancy, as circumstances may require. He also converses
freely in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. The high esteem
in which he is held by his Irish fellow citizens is best shown by the
fact that they have never missed an occasion to put him in every
place of honor and trust within their gift. He is at present their
worthy representative in the parliament of the Province of Quebec,
as a member of the West Division of the city, which, though it contains
the leading British commercial men of Quebec, is controlled
by the Irish vote. Mr. Carbray is an eloquent and forcible orator,
his recent speech on the occasion of the reading of ‘the speech from
the throne,’ having been pronounced by the Canadian press as the
most remarkable English speech ever delivered in the Quebec legislature.
In his public capacity Mr. Carbray has never made an
enemy, while as a private citizen he has hosts of friends.” Rose, in
his <cite>Cyclopedia of Canadian Biography</cite>, says of him: He was educated
at Quebec, where he has resided throughout his life, though
he has traveled extensively in America and Europe, principally on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>business connected with the trade in lumber, in which his house is
engaged. He was one of the pioneers of the lumber trade between
the St. Lawrence and South America, and is still largely interested
in it. In addition to his other duties, he fills the important position
of consul of Portugal at the port of Quebec. A Catholic in religion,
Mr. Carbray has been honored by the St. Patrick’s congregation of
Quebec with election and re-election as one of the trustees, and is also
a trustee of that noble Irish Catholic charity, the St. Bridget’s Asylum
of Quebec. He has taken an equally active and leading part in all the
local national movements of his fellow countrymen, and has been
president of the St. Patrick’s Literary Institute, the Irish National
Association, and other Irish bodies in Quebec. He is a Liberal-Conservative
in politics, and at the provincial general elections in 1881,
yielding to the solicitations of his friends, he ran as the party candidate
for the electoral division of Quebec West, and, after a hard
fight, was elected by a good majority to represent that constituency
in the legislative assembly in the province. His parliamentary
career was very creditable. Though he did not often address the
house, he was always listened to with the utmost respect, being an
equally good speaker and debater in both English and French, and
never wasting his powder except on serious and interesting subjects
with which he was most conversant, such, especially, as questions of
finance and commerce. In May, 1854, he married Miss Margaret
Carberry, a daughter of the late William Carberry of Carrick-on-Suir,
Ireland, of whom he had four sons and six daughters. Those
still living are: Herbert of Montreal; William, Quebec; Thomas
John, a promising lawyer; Mrs. P. L. Connor, Boston; Mrs. Alfred
Carroll, Montreal, and Grace. His youngest daughter, Grace, and
son, Thomas, live with him at “Benburb Place,” and the Ramparts.
Mrs. Carbray died in May, 1895. She was a patriotic Irish woman
and revered and esteemed for her piety and devotedness to God’s
poor. In October, 1902, he married Miss Brigid Carberry—widow
of the late Nicholas K. Connolly—sister of his first wife.
The marriage ceremony was performed at St. Gabriel’s Church, New
York, by Archbishop Farley. She died on July 1, 1903, deeply
regretted by her sorrowing husband and all who knew her. A most
amiable lady and, like her sister, devoted to the poor. Mr. Carbray
filled many distinguished positions in his life; he is held in high
esteem by his fellow citizens of all races, creeds and politics. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>was a member of the Quebec Harbor Commission, of the Quebec
Board of Trade, consul for Portugal, and, being the oldest consul
here, is dean of the Consular Corps, senior trustee of St. Patrick’s
Church, of the St. Bridget’s Asylum Association, president of the
United Irish League, etc., etc. Mr. Carbray was an ardent upholder
of the movement for the revival of the Irish language. He delivered
a lecture on this subject at Tara Hall, Quebec, in April, 1899, which
displayed profound knowledge of the subject, and attracted the
attention and encomiums of the whole Celtic world. Mr. Carbray
had a collection of books on Ireland which formed probably the
best of its kind in Canada. He was a member of the Royal Irish
Academy.</p>

Cavan, Ireland, 1842; came to this country when he was but ten years of
age, and spent much of his youth at East Dennis, Cape Cod, Mass. His
early love for the sea was gratified later in life when he became captain
of some of the finest deep-water ships sailing from Baltimore, Boston and
elsewhere. His first command was the bark <i>May Queen</i>, a regular Baltimore
and Rio packet, 1872. He then had command of the ship <i>Pilgrim</i>
of Boston, and made several voyages to the East Indies. In 1884 he was
given command of the <i>Charger</i>, a larger and finer ship than the <i>Pilgrim</i>,
and sailed to ports in Japan. He next had command of the <i>South American</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“the Commodore’s ship,” of the Hastings fleet (Boston), and took
her to Australia and other parts. He made several record voyages during
his career, and some of these records still stand, having never been
equalled. On one occasion he was wrecked off the coast of Africa; he
and his wife upon being rescued were hospitably entertained by the Boers
of the adjacent country. Returning to East Dennis, Mass., his wife’s
health became poor and so he removed with her to Coronado, Cal., hoping
that the change of climate would benefit her, but she died in 1901. She
had accompanied her husband on several of his voyages, and had with
him visited many parts of the world. Captain Connolly has written much
and entertainingly. He has at present in manuscript form a novel of
ocean life entitled <cite>The Magic of the Sea</cite>.</p>

<p class='c022'><strong>Doyle, John F.</strong>, of John F. Doyle &amp; Sons, 45 William Street, New York
City. (Life member of the Society.) Mr. Doyle is the senior member
of the real estate firm of John F. Doyle &amp; Sons. He was born in New
York City, 1837, a son of James Doyle, who participated in the Irish revolution
of 1798, and who came to the United States early in 1806. This
James Doyle, the immigrant, had a son who was killed in the Florida
war of 1837, and a grandson who fell in 1861, fighting for the Union.
John F. Doyle, the subject of this sketch and member of the Society,
entered the law office of Alexander Hamilton, grandson of the first secretary
of the treasury, afterwards the firm of Hamilton, Rives &amp; Rogers,
and remained with them from 1853 to 1869, in the meantime studying
law and being admitted to the bar in 1862. Alexander Hamilton, Francis
R. Rives, a son of William C. Rives, of Virginia, at one time minister to
France and senator, and Nathan Pendleton Rogers, all of the old Revolutionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>stock, were members of the firm. Mr. Doyle’s management of
some Wall Street properties for them at this period became so conspicuous
that he was urged by them to assume the management of their estates,
which he did. Shortly afterwards followed the acquisition of the estates of
such well-known people as Mrs. Harriet L. Langdon, granddaughter-in-law
of the first John Jacob Astor, John Pyne March, Mrs. Morgan L. Livingston,
George L. Schuyler, James M. Pendleton, A. Newbold Morris,
James H. Jones, John Steward, Jr., Royal Phelps, deceased, Royal Phelps
Carroll, Robert S. Minturn, estate of Gertrude L. Lowndes, deceased,
William H. King, of Newport, R. I., and others too numerous to mention
in detail. A feature of his career as a successful manager lies in the fact
that the business associations and connections formed by him in the
beginning are still held intact. Among the notable sales made by him are
those from William H. Morris to John Jacob Astor in 1880, conveying 150
acres of lots in the twenty-third ward on and adjacent to Harlem River;
the great sale of South Brooklyn lots at Gowanus Bay in 1884. Mr. Doyle
represents today the same old and well-known families and estates represented
by him so many years ago. During his career Mr. Doyle has
met and done business with some of the most notable men connected with
families notable in American history, such as three of the four sons
of the first Alexander Hamilton, Admiral Farragut, Capt. Percival Drayton,
Rawlins Lowndes, of South Carolina, William C. Rives, U. S. senator
from Virginia, at one time minister to France, George L. Schuyler,
grandson of Philip Schuyler and owner of the famous yacht America,
Philip Schuyler, his son, Henry Grinnell of Arctic fame, Robert J. and
Mortimer Livingston, Hon. John Lee Carroll, Commodore Wm. K. Vanderbilt,
and scores of others equally well known, besides representing
branches now of four lineal descendants of signers of the Declaration of
Independence. His two sons, Col. John F. Doyle, Jr., and Alfred L.
Doyle, have been with him in business for years past and all three enjoy
an enviable reputation for integrity, ability and prudence in all their
undertakings.</p>

<p class='c022'><strong>Hanrahan, John D.</strong> (M. D.), Rutland, Vt., a native of County Limerick,
Ireland; was graduated in medicine from the University of the City of
New York, 1867; in June, 1861, he was, on examination (not having
graduated), appointed surgeon in the United States Navy, and served
through the entire Civil War. The vessels on which he served did duty
mostly on the rivers of Virginia and North Carolina, where he served
with the army as well as the navy, thereby having the benefit and experience
of both branches of the service, especially in the surgical line. In
August, 1863, the vessel on which he was serving was captured at the
mouth of the Rappahannock River and all on board made prisoners.
They were taken overland to Richmond where they were confined in Libby
Prison. At that time the Confederates were very short of surgeons and
medical supplies, and he was asked if he would go over to Belle Island
and attend the Union prisoners. After consulting his fellow-prisoners he
consented, and for six weeks he attended the sick and wounded Union
prisoners faithfully, under very great disadvantages, as the appliances
were very limited. After that he was paroled. While a prisoner of war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>he was treated with the greatest courtesy and consideration by the medical
staff and officers of the Confederacy. After the close of the war he was
settled in New York City, but for nearly forty years has been a resident
of Rutland, Vt. He was town and city physician of Rutland for many
years. He was appointed surgeon of the Third Vermont Regiment, 1871,
by Governor Stewart; was the first president of the Rutland County
Medical and Surgical Society; has been a director and consulting surgeon
of the Rutland (Vt.) Hospital; consulting surgeon to the Fanny Allen
Hospital, Winooski, Vt.; a member of the Vermont Sanitary Association,
and a member of the Vermont Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis;
president of Rutland Village two years and trustee eight years; county
commissioner one year; president, United States pension examining board
four years under President Cleveland, and president of the same board
four years under President Harrison. He was postmaster of Rutland
during the second term of President Cleveland. He has since its organization
been an active member of the G. A. R.; surgeon of Roberts Post,
the largest in Vermont; has served three terms as medical director of the
Department; served on the staffs of three commanders-in-chief—Veasy,
Palmer and Weissert; a member of Commander-in-Chief Stewart’s staff.
Doctor Hanrahan is the author of several medical papers, has performed
many surgical operations, and has served through several epidemics of
smallpox and diphtheria. He was a delegate to the Democratic National
conventions of 1884, 1888, and chairman of the Vermont delegation to
the National Convention of 1892. Also a delegate to the Democratic
National Convention in St. Louis, 1904, and to the Ancient Order of
Hibernians convention in St. Louis, July 19, 1904.</p>

<p class='c022'><strong>Kelly, Eugene</strong>, Templecourt Building, New York City.</p>

<p class='c022'><strong>Kelly, John Forrest</strong> (Ph. D.), Pittsfield, Mass.; born near Carrick-on-Suir,
Ireland. He was educated in Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken,
N. J., received the degree of B. L. in 1878 and that of Ph. D. in 1881.
His first occupation was as assistant to Thomas A. Edison, in Menlo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Park laboratory, his work then principally relating to the chemistry of
rare earths. Late in 1879 Mr. Kelly became electrical engineer of the
New York branch of the Western Electric Company. This was the time
when the telephone was being generally introduced, and when dynamos
were being first applied to telegraphic purposes. In the construction and
installment of instruments for telegraphy and telephones and of such
measuring instruments as were then known, Mr. Kelly received a thorough
training. In 1882 he became laboratory assistant to Edward Weston, then
chief electrician of the United States Electric Lighting Company, and,
with the exception of a year which he spent in connection with the Remingtons,
Mr. Kelly continued his association with Mr. Weston until July,
1886. Some of the most important work, such as the research which ended
in the discovery of high resistance alloys of very low or even negative
temperature co-efficients, were substantially carried out by Mr. Kelly under
general directions from Mr. Weston, whom Mr. Kelly succeeded as chief
electrician of the United States Electric Lighting Company, which, in
1889, passed to the Westinghouse interests; but Mr. Kelly retained his
position as chief electrician until January, 1892, when he resigned to join
William Stanley in experimental work. The work done by Mr. Kelly, in
this connection, gave a great impetus to the alternating current business.
Mr. Kelly’s inventive work is partially represented by eighty patents. The
art of building transformers and generators of alternating currents was
revolutionized, and Mr. Kelly and his colleagues were the first to put
polyphase motors into actual commercial service. That success naturally
led to long-distance transmission work, and the first long-distance transmission
plants in California (indeed the first in the world), were undertaken
on Mr. Kelly’s recommendation and advice. He was the first to
make a hysteretically stable steel, a matter of vastly more importance than
the comparatively spectacular transmission work. Mr. Kelly at present
occupies the position of president of the John F. Kelly Engineering Company,
president of the Cokel Company and president of the Telelectric
Company, as well as president of the Conchas River Power Company and
director of the Southwestern Exploration Company. The Cokel Company
is organized to exploit the invention of Mr. E. W. Cooke, by means of
which foodstuffs may be perfectly dehydrated, losing on the average ninety
per cent in weight. Foods dehydrated by this process, although free from
all chemical preservatives, are entirely stable, and yet preserve their pristine
freshness through extremes of temperature, and when served are
indistinguishable from fresh foods of the ordinary type. The Telelectric
Company is organized for the manufacture of electric piano players, which
are either entirely automatic or entirely controllable at will. Mr. Kelly
was married to Miss Helen Fischer, in New York City, in 1892, and they
have two children—Eoghan and Domnall. Mr. Kelly is a thorough and
unswerving Irish Nationalist, and his splendid generosity to the cause is
well known.</p>

<p class='c022'><strong>McClure, David</strong>, lawyer, 22 William Street, New York City. Mr. McClure
was admitted to the bar in December, 1869, in New York City, where he
has since resided. His practice has brought him very prominently before
the courts and public during the last thirty-six years as counsel in cases
which have attracted much attention. He has been counsel in many contested
will cases, including those of Merril, Schuyler Skatts, Charles B.
Beck and Mary Johnson. In the Livingston, De Meli and General Burnside
litigation he was also prominent.  He has been connected with many
large corporation foreclosure suits, including those of the Denver Water
Company, the New York &amp; Northern Railroad Company, Omaha Water
Company, the Toledo, Ann Arbor &amp; Northern Michigan, the Northern
Pacific, the New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western, the Oregon Railway &amp;
Navigation Company, the Oregon Improvement Company, the Chicago &amp;
Northern Pacific Company, the Bankers and Merchants’ Telegraph Company,
and the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad Company. He is regarded
as one of the most successful trial lawyers at the bar in New York. Mr.
McClure for more than a quarter of a century has been counsel for the
Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Company, the oldest and largest trust company
in the United States, organized in 1821; and for many years of the Consolidated
Gas Company, one of the largest public service corporations in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the country. He is also counsel for the West Side Savings Bank, several
fire insurance companies and other banks. He was one of the counsel for
the Mutual Life Insurance Company during the presidency of F. S.
Winston. For years he was a director in the Lawyers Surety Company,
and he is on the board of the Title Insurance Company of New York.
He was a prominent and active member of the State Constitution Convention
of 1894, in which body he introduced and carried through the
amendment providing for protection of the forests of New York. He years
ago declined elevation to the bench of the Court of Appeals, the highest
court in the state of New York, and several times to other positions;
also appointment to the offices of corporation counsel of the city of New
York, and district attorney of the United States. Mr. McClure was appointed,
in 1893, receiver of the National Bank of Deposit, in the city of
New York, and in spite of the stringent financial condition which prevailed
during the summer of that year, dividends aggregating seventy-five
per cent were paid within three months. The entire indebtedness, principal
and interest, was paid and the receivership closed out within one year.
In 1892 he was a delegate from the state of New York to the National
Democratic Convention which, at Chicago, nominated Grover Cleveland
as candidate for the office of president of the United States, and during
the campaign of that year he was much discussed by the press of New
York as the probable nominee of his party for the office of mayor of the
city. In that year he was designated by the General Term of the Supreme
Court, chairman of the first commission appointed to determine
whether a subway passing under Broadway and other streets through the
city should be constructed, his associates being Robert Maclay, president of
the Knickerbocker Trust Company, and Benjamin Perkins. Prior to the
adoption by the United States government of the Panama Canal project,
and during the presidency of Mr. McKinley, one of the largest, if not
the largest, syndicates of moneyed men ever gathered together obtained a
concession from the government of Nicaragua for the construction of a
canal known as the Nicaragua Canal. This syndicate, which proposed to
build the canal without government aid, was composed of the Messrs.
Vanderbilt, Astor, Rockefeller, Mills, Stillman, Grace, Crimmins, and
others of equal standing, and was represented before the committee of
Congress upon the question of recognition and protection, by Mr. McClure
as its counsel, he having organized the corporation under which it
was proposed to operate. Mr. McClure is a member of the Manhattan,
New York Athletic and other clubs, and the Bar Association; of which
he has been a member of the judiciary and other committees. He has
also been honored with the presidency of the Metropolitan Surety
Company.</p>

Penn, Del., August 4, 1843. He is the son of John and Catherine (Caldwell)
McGowan. He was educated in the public schools of Philadelphia,
Pa., 1848–’53, and in private schools in Elizabeth, N. J., 1854–’59. Entering
the navy, he was appointed acting master’s mate, March 8, 1862;
was promoted to acting master May 8, 1862, and ordered to command
the U. S. S. <i>Wyandank</i> in the Potomac flotilla. He served on the Potomac
and Rappahannock rivers until February, 1863, when he was detached
from the <i>Wyandank</i> and ordered to the <i>Florida</i> as navigator. He served
on the <i>Florida</i> in the blockade off Wilmington, N. C., until October, 1864,
when the ship went to New York for repairs. In November, of the same
year, he was detached from the <i>Florida</i> and ordered to the U. S. S. <i>State
of Georgia</i> as navigator; arrived off Wilmington, N. C., the day after
the capture of Fort Fisher, his ship being then ordered to reinforce the
fleet off Charleston, S. C. While there he took part in the Bulls Bay
Expedition, which was one of the causes of the evacuation of Charleston
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>by the Confederates. Soon after the evacuation, the <i>State of Georgia</i> was
ordered to Aspinwall (Colon) to protect American interests on the Isthmus
of Panama. Before sailing for Aspinwall, McGowan succeeded
Lieutenant Manly as executive officer of the ship. In November, 1865, he
was ordered to the U. S. S. <i>Monongahela</i> as watch and division officer;
served on the <i>Monongahela</i> in the West Indies until January, 1867, when
he was detached and, a few days later, joined the U. S. S. <i>Tacony</i>, Commander
Roe, fitting out for duty in the Gulf Squadron. He was at Vera
Cruz nearly all the summer of 1867, which witnessed the fall of Maximilian’s
empire. After the death of Maximilian, and the surrender of Vera
Cruz to the Liberals, the <i>Tacony</i> returned to Pensacola, Fla., but yellow
fever breaking out aboard, the ship went to Portsmouth, N. H., where,
after undergoing quarantine, the officers were detached and ordered to
their homes the latter part of September, 1867. In October of the same
year, McGowan was ordered to duty on board the receiving ship at the
Philadelphia navy yard. He commanded the U. S. S. <i>Constellation</i> there,
and was afterward executive officer of the frigate <i>Potomac</i>, also a receiving
ship, at Philadelphia. In March, 1868, while on the <i>Potomac</i>, he received
a commission as master in the regular navy, and in October, 1868, was
ordered to duty with the Asiatic fleet. On reporting to the admiral, he
was ordered to duty as executive officer of the U. S. S. <i>Unadilla</i>; succeeded
to the command of the <i>Unadilla</i> in June, 1869, and in November of
that year was detached from the <i>Unadilla</i> and ordered to the U. S. S.
<i>Iroquois</i>; returned in her to the United States, the ship going out of commission
in April, 1870. In April, 1870, he was promoted to be lieutenant-commander
and while in that grade served on the double-turreted monitor
<i>Terror</i>, the <i>Wachusett</i>, <i>Juniata</i> and <i>Marion</i> as executive officer, and at
the League Island, Philadelphia and Brooklyn navy yards. In January,
1887, he was promoted to commander; commanded the <i>Swatara</i>, <i>St.
Mary’s</i>, <i>Portsmouth</i> and <i>Alliance</i>, and was also commandant of the naval
training station at Newport, R. I., from December, 1896, to July, 1899.
He was promoted captain, February, 1899, and in August took command of
the U. S. S. <i>Monadnock</i> at Manila. In November, 1900, he was ordered
to duty as commandant of the naval station at Key West, Fla. In April,
1901, he was detached and ordered before the retiring board. He was
retired, with the rank of rear admiral, in April, 1901. In October, 1871,
he wedded Evelyn Manderson of Philadelphia. Admiral McGowan is a
member of the military order of the Loyal Legion, of the Order of Foreign
Wars, the Sons of the Revolution, and of the Society of Marine
Engineers and Naval Architects. He is also a member of the following
clubs: the Metropolitan and Chevy Chase of Washington, D. C.; the
Rittenhouse of Philadelphia, the Union of New York, and the New York
Yacht Club. Admiral McGowan’s father, Capt. John McGowan, was
appointed a lieutenant in the revenue cutter service by President Andrew
Jackson. He was at Charleston, S. C., during the nullification period,
served in the Seminole War, in the War with Mexico, and in the Civil
War. He commanded the steamer <i>Star of the West</i> in the attempt to
reinforce Fort Sumter in 1861. He died in January, 1891, aged 85 years.</p>

of Gainesville; alternate commissioner to World’s Fair, Chicago, Ill., 1893;
vice-president for Georgia, American Bankers’ Association. Colonel Sanders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>is of Irish and English ancestry. On the maternal side he is descended
from Thomas and Theodosia M. Smyth, who emigrated from Ireland in
1793, landing in Charleston, S. C. They settled in Jones County, Ga.
Thomas died November 28, 1799. On the paternal side Colonel Sanders
is a descendant of Rev. Moses Sanders, who emigrated from England,
with two brothers, John and David, and arrived in Petersburg, Va., 1765.
They embraced the patriotic cause in the Revolution and were active in
operations against the British. Colonel Sanders, the subject of this sketch,
graduated from the Georgia Military Institute, in June, 1861; entered the
Confederate service; was made lieutenant-colonel of the Twenty-fourth
Regiment of Infantry, Georgia Volunteers, August, 1861; served under
General Lee in the Peninsular campaign, in the seven days’ battles around
Richmond, Va., and was among the bravest of the brave; commanded his
regiment at Malvern Hill and at Marye’s Heights, Fredericksburg, where
the Twenty-fourth was a part of the Confederate forces that received the
valorous charges of Meagher’s Irish Brigade. He also commanded the
regiment at the battles of Chancellorsville and Antietam, at which latter
conflict he was placed in command of Wofford’s Brigade. While in this
position he met a bayonet charge from the Federals by a counter bayonet
charge, and in the desperate fighting that ensued, fifty-eight per cent of
Sanders’ heroic force was swept away. Colonel Sanders also led the
Twenty-fourth at Cedar Creek, Chickamauga, Knoxville, the Wilderness,
Spottsylvania Court House, and Sailor’s Creek. On April 6, 1865, Ewell’s
Corps, to which Colonel Sanders’ regiment was then attached, was captured,
and Colonel Sanders was sent as a prisoner of war to Washington,
D. C. Writing of Meagher’s Irish Brigade, Colonel Sanders says: “I
was in command of the Twenty-fourth Georgia Regiment, with other
troops, at the foot of Marye’s Heights, receiving the five heroic and gallant
charges of the Irish Brigade, whose prodigies of valor have filled the
country with admiration. I saw the devoted Irish charge up to our
breastworks, to be mowed down by a line of Confederate fire that no
soldiers could withstand.  I saw the Irish battalions cut down like grain
before the reaper, yet the survivors would magnificently close up their
ranks only to have huge gaps again cut through them. When forced back
they rallied and came bravely on again, only to be riddled with bullets and
torn by artillery. Their fifth charge was made with greatly decimated
ranks that slowly recoiled like the waves of a tempestuous sea. When
twilight descended upon the scene, a spectacle was presented unequaled
in warfare. At least three fourths of my command was composed of men
of Irish descent and knew that the gallant dead in our front were our
kindred of the land beyond the sea. When, one by one, the stars came
out that night, many tears were shed by Southern Confederate eyes for the
heroic Federal Irish dead.” During the war Colonel Sanders was offered
the rank of brigadier-general but declined the same.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Society was organized on January 20, 1897, in Boston, Mass.,
and now has members in many states, the District of Columbia, one
territory and two foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c011'>Briefly stated, the object of the organization is to make better
known the Irish chapter in American history.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are two classes of members in the organization,—Life and
Annual. The life membership fee is $50 (paid once). The fee for
annual members is $5, paid yearly. In the case of new annual members,
the initiation fee, $5, also pays the membership dues for the
first year.</p>

<p class='c011'>The board of government comprises a president-general, a vice-president-general,
a secretary-general, a treasurer-general, a librarian
and archivist, and an executive council. There are also state vice-presidents.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Society has already issued several bound volumes and a number
of other publications. These have been distributed to the members
and to public libraries; also to historical organizations and to
universities. Each member of the Society is entitled, free of charge,
to a copy of every publication issued from the time of his admittance.
These publications are of great interest and value, and are more than
an equivalent for the membership fee.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Society draws no lines of creed or politics. Being an American
organization in spirit and principle, it welcomes to its ranks
Americans of whatever race descent, and of whatever creed, who
take an interest in the objects for which the Society is organized.
Membership application blanks will be furnished on request.</p>

<p class='c011'>The membership includes many people of prominence, and has
been addressed by many distinguished men. It occupies a position
in the front rank of American historical organizations.</p>

with great satisfaction and am happy and proud to know that the glorious

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“To make better known the Irish Chapter in American History,” your neat
and wholesome volume will undoubtedly contribute much, for the spirit manifested
throughout the book is such as to beget love of the race and an interest
to continue reading. And you build up the glorious edifice of true American-Irish
history by simply claiming your due and disparaging no man. This intention,
your illustrious President-General McGowan, in his address to the
members of the Society, has chivalrously expressed in these memorable words:
“We rob no race to gild the Irish name when we undertake to unearth the
records of the past.... We merely wish to claim, assert and
set forth the credit which to us belongs, for the part that men and women of
Irish blood took in bringing about the reign of liberty and freedom we now
enjoy.... We do not wish to praise ourselves by ‘masquerading
in borrowed plumes,’ nor have we any desire to detract one iota from the
credit that is honestly that of others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Wishing you and your Society continued success and influence, and thanking
you once again for your kindness, believe me,</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
